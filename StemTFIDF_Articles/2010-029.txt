Adaptive Interest Rate Modelling
Mengmeng Guo, Wolfgang Karl Ha¨rdle 
May 21, 2010
Abstract
A good description of the dynamics of interest rates is crucial to price derivatives and to hedge corresponding risk. Interest rate modelling in an unstable macroeconomic context motivates one factor models with time varying parameters. In this paper, the local parameter approach is introduced to adaptively estimate interest rate models. This method can be generally used in time varying coefficient parametric models. It is used not only to detect the jumps and structural breaks, but also to choose the largest time homogeneous interval for each time point, such that in this interval, the coefficients are statistically constant. We use this adaptive approach and apply it in simulations and real data. Using the three month treasure bill rate as a proxy of the short rate, we find that our method can detect both structural changes and stable intervals for homogeneous modelling of the interest rate process. In more unstable macroeconomy periods, the time homogeneous interval can not last long. Furthermore, our approach performs well in long horizon forecasting.

1 Introduction
Interest rate risk, caused by the variability of interest rates, is the risk borne by an interest-bearing asset, such as a loan or a bond. It is commonly measured by the bond's duration. Interest rate risk causes credit risk, which in turn may induce further risks (subprime crisis). For hedging purposes, however, it is important to price the interest rate derivatives which of course depend on the dynamic process of the interest rate. If the macroeconomy is unstable, the variation of interest rate will be larger, and vice versa. For instance, in 2002, bubbles existed in the stock market. In 2003, the war in Iraq influenced the macroeconomy. Since 2007, the macroeconomy has been depressed by the subprime crisis. We find the short rate in these periods more fluctuating. On the other hand, changes in business cycle conditions may influence the dynamics, and they may differ from one period to another. The stochastics of short rates are impacted by these facts, which return shock reverting behaviour of stochastic interest rate volatility less persistent to economic shocks. These shocks or news are dominated by central bank announcements of base rate changes. The short rates respond quickly to these unanticipated announcements. This conclusion can be supported by Jones, Lmont, and Lumsdaine (1998) who documented that volatility shocks to U.S. treasure bonds arising from scheduled macroeconomic announcements are not persistent at all. A large number of empirical studies have demonstrated the unstable property of the interest rate process. The instability can be induced by structural breaks, or regime switchings, even the process can be a smooth function of time.
Due to this instability in statistical modelling, a wide variety of interest rate models have been introduced. Three main strands of literature exist to describe the dynamics. On one hand, the instability is induced by the structural breaks, which are captured by jump diffusion models. In this kind of model, it is assumed that several jumps exist in the diffusion function to capture the structural breaks. Das (2002) incorporated jumps into the Vasicek model and found strong evidence of jumps in the daily federal funds rate. Johannes (2003) used a nonparametric diffusion model to study the secondary three month treasury bills. He concluded that jumps are generally generated by the arrival of news about the macroeconomy. A common conclusion is that the nonlinearity exists in the dynamics of short rates. Another strand of literature uses regime switching models to capture the business cycle character of interest rates, see Ang and Bekaert (2002), Bansal and Zhou (2002). They
2

found that the interest rate has significant changes and its variation performs differently in different regimes. In the third kind of model, the process parameters (drift or volatility) are assumed to be a function of time, Hull-White (1990), BlackKarasinski (1991), A¨it-Sahalia (1996) and Stanton (1997), Fan et al (2003) and Arapis and Gao (2006). The conclusion of them is that the coefficients in the CIR model are time varying, moreover they proved that the drift function is nonlinear. Generally speaking, a one factor short rate model with constant parameters may not be valid for a long period of time in reality.
In this paper, we introduce a time varying CIR model and estimate it from a novel point of view - the local parametric approach (LPA). Our aim is to find the longest stable "time homogeneous" interval for each time point t, where the parameters in the CIR model can be safely assumed to be constant. More attractively, by this method, we can detect jumps and structural break points. Furthermore, this approach includes regime switching models and it also describes the time variation of coefficients. Based on the parameters inside the selected interval, one may distinguish blooming and declining regimes of the economy.
The proposed approach may be applied to different problems. Giacomini, H¨ardle and Spokoiny (2009) considered time varying copulae estimation, C´izek, H¨ardle and Spokoiny (2009) applied it to compare the performance of global and time varying ARCH and GARCH specifications, Ha¨rdle, Okhrin and Okhrin (2010) applied this method to hierarchical archimedean copulae, and found that the LPA can be used to detect both adaptive copulae parameters and local dependency structures.
To assess the performance of the LPA, we do both simulations and empirical studies. In the simulation exercise, we show that the proposed LPA detects the structural breaks very well, and the true parameters are located in the pointwise confidence intervals of the estimators. In the empirical study, we use three month treasure bill rate as a proxy of the short rate and investigate the performance of the LPA by both in sample fitting and out of sample forecasting via comparing with moving window estimators.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a short recall about one factor interest rate models, later we explain the LPA in detail in Section 3. In Section 4, we present our simulation results. Empirical studies are

presented in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.

2 Interest Rate Models

We give a short review about one factor interest rate models. Note that we need the essential properties:

· Mean reversion: the interests rates always tend to return to an average level. · The interest rate r(t) is non negative.

Vasicek Model

dr(t) = a{b - r(t)}dt + dWt

where a, b and  are constants, Wt is a standard Brownian process. It is consistent with the mean reversion feature with a reversion speed a to the long run mean level b. However, in this model r(t) can be negative.

Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR) Model

dr(t) = a{b - r(t)}dt +  r(t)dWt

(1)

The drift function µ{r(t)} = a{b - r(t)} is linear and possesses a mean reverting property, i.e. r(t) moves in the direction of its long run mean b at speed a. The diffusion function 2{r(t)} = r(t)2 is proportional to the interest rate r(t) and ensures that the process stays on a positive domain. Here r(t) has a positive impact on the standard deviation through (1).

Hull-White Model
dr(t) = {(t) - ar(t)}dt + dWt
This is an extended Vasicek model, where a and  are constant, (t) is a deterministic function of time. Moreover, this model uses the time dependent reversion level (t)/a instead of the constant b in Vasicek model.

Black-Karasinski Model d log r(t) = (t){log µ(t) - log r(t)}dt + (t)dWt 4

with (t), µ(t) and (t) as a deterministic function of time, where µ(t) as the target interest rate. A drawback of this model is that no closed form formula for valuing bonds in terms of r(t) can be derived by this model.

3 Methodology

In the Vasicek model, the interest rate r(t) can be negative. As an improvement of the Vasicek model, the CIR model guarantees the interest rate is not negative. In the Hull-White model, the volatility is a constant. The Black-Karasinski model assumes (t) and µ(t) are deterministic function of time. However, all these models are too restrictive due to the unstable macroeconomy. In this section, a new method - the LPA for time varying CIR model is introduced. The method allows the parameters vary over time as the time homogeneous interval changes with t. Discontinuities and jumps may be detected and used to identify structural changes.

The time varying CIR model is expressed as:

dr(t) = at{bt - r(t)}dt + t r(t)dWt

(2)

where, Wt is the standard Wiener Process. Denote the time varying parameters as t = (at, bt, t) . This CIR model (2) includes all of the aforementioned parametric models, such as jump diffusion models, regime switching models, and also the nonparametric specified time varying interest rate models.

The discrete version of (2) is:

Yi

(3)

Where {Zi}Ti=1 are normally distributed with zero mean and variance t = ti+1 - ti,

(more generally, Zi can be a white noise process). The time unit may be one year,

3.1 Likelihood Function of CIR Process

If a, b,  are all positive, and 2ab  2 holds, then the CIR model is well defined

and has a steady state distribution. Given rt at time t, the density of rt+t at time

point t + t is:

p(rt+t|rt;

,

t)

=

ce-u-v (

v u

)

q 2

 Iq(a uv)

(4)

5

where
2a c = 2(1 - e-at) u = crte-at
v = crt+t 2ab
q = 2  and Iq(2 uv) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind with order q. The log likelihood function is given by:

T -1
L() = log p(rti+1|rti; , t)
i=1

(5)

Fix now t, the MLE estimator ~Ik in any interval Ik = [t - mk, t] is:

~Ik = arg max LIk () = arg max log p(rti+1|rti; , t)
iIk

The accuracy of the estimation for a locally constant model with parameter 0 is measured via the log likelihood ratio LIk (~Ik , 0) = LIk (~Ik ) - LIk (0). In C´izek, Ha¨rdle and Spokoiny (2009), it is proved that if Yi follows a nonlinear process (2),
then given Ik for any r > 0, there exists a constant r(0), such that:

E0 |LIk (~Ik , 0)|r  r(0)

(6)

Thus, r(0) can be treated as the parametric risk bound. It enables testing the parametric hypothesis on the basis of the fitted log likelihood LIk(~Ik, 0).

3.2 Test of Homogeneous Intervals
Mercurio and Spokoiny (2004), C´izek, Ha¨rdle and Spokoiny (2009) and Spokoiny (2009) are informative references for the LPA. The general idea can be described as follows: suppose we have K (historical) candidate intervals with a starting interval I0, i.e. I0  I1  · · ·  IK, Ik = [t - mk, t] with 0 < mk < t. We increase the length from mk to mk+1, and test over the larger interval Ik+1 whether ~k+1 is still consistent with ~k. To test an interval Ik = [t-mk, t], we set the null (2) with a fixed parameter . The alternative is to find an unknown change point  in the interval Ik, i.e. Yl follows one process when t  J = [ + 1, t] with parameter J , and it follows another process when t  Jc = [t - mk+1,  ] with parameter Jc, where J = Jc.

With this alternative, the likelihood can be expressed as LJ (~J ) + LJc(~Jc), giving the test statistics:

TIk+1, = LJ (~J ) + LJc (~Jc ) - LIk+1 (~Ik+1 )

(7)

where   Jk = Ik\Ik-1, see Figure 1. Since the change point   Ik is unknown, we consider the maximum of the test statistics over Jk:

Tk

The selected longest time homogeneous interval satisfies

(8)

Tk  zk,

for k  k^

(9)

and Tk^+1 > zk^+1. Then Ik^ is the longest time homogeneous interval for time point t, and the local adaptive estimator ^t = ^Ik^ . The event {Ik is rejected} means that T > z for some < k, and hence a change point has been detected in the first k
steps within Ik. zk is the critical value (depending on the interval sequence Ik) to
be introduced later.

3.3 The Local Parametric Approach (LPA)
For any given t with the intervals I0  I1  · · ·  IK, following the idea mentioned above, the algorithm is described into four steps.
1. We estimate ~I0 using the observations from the smallest interval I0 = [t - m0, t], ~I0 is always accepted.
2. We increase the interval to Ik, (k  1), get the estimator ~Ik by MLE, and test homogeneity via (7), i.e. we test whether there is a change point in Ik. If (9) is fulfilled, we go on to step 3, otherwise we go to step 4.
7

3. Let ^Ik = ~Ik, then further set k = k + 1, and go to step 2.
4. Accept as the longest time homogeneous interval Ik^ = Ik-1, and define the local adaptive estimator as ^Ik^ = ~Ik-1. Additionally set ^Ik^ = ^Ik = · · · = ^IK for all k > k^.
For a change point  in Ik, we obtain k^ = k - 1, and Ik^ = Ik-1 is the selected longest time homogenous interval. We compare the test statistics with the critical values, if it is smaller than the critical value zk, we accept Ik as the time homogeneous interval, then we increase the interval to Ik+1, and do the test again. We sequentially repeat this procedure until we stop at some k < K or we exhaust all the chosen intervals. For each time point t, we use the same algorithm, and we do not to calculate the critical values a second time, since they depend on only the parametric specification and the length of interval mk, not on t.

To investigate the performance of the adaptive estimator, we introduce the small modelling bias (SMB). The SMB for interval Ik is:

Ik() = K{r(t), r(t; )}
tIk
with K the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence,

K{r(t),

r(t;

)}

=

E

log

p{r(t)} p{r(t; )}

(10) (11)

where p(.) and p(.; ) are the probability density functions of r(t) and r(t; ) respec-

tively. The SMB measures in terms of KL divergence the closeness of a constant

parametric model with p(.; ) to a time varying model with p(.). Suppose now that

for a fixed  > 0:

E Ik()  

(12)

(12) simply means that for some   , Ik() is bounded by a small constant with a high probability, which implies the time varying model can be well approximated

over Ik by the parametric model with fixed parameter .

Under this SMB condition for some interval Ik and   , one has the property:

E log{1 + |LIk (~Ik , )|r }  1 +  Rr()

(13)

If  is not large, (13) extends the parametric risk bounds to the nonparametric situation under the SMB condition, see C´izek, Ha¨rdle and Spokoiny (2009). An

8

"oracle" choice Ik from the set I0, · · · , IK exists, which is defined as the largest interval satisfying (12). We denote the corresponding "oracle" parameter as Ik .
However, two types of errors occur in this algorithm: the first type is to reject the time homogeneous interval earlier than the "oracle" step, which means k^  k. The other type is to reject the homogeneous interval later than the "oracle" step, i.e. k^ > k. The first type of error can be treated as a "false alarm", i.e. the algorithm stops earlier than the "oracle" interval Ik, which leads to selecting an estimate with a larger variation than Ik . The second type of the error arises if k^ > k. Outside the oracle interval we are exploiting data which does not support the SMB condition. Both errors will be specified in a propagation and stability condition in the next section.

3.4 Choice of Critical Values

The accuracy of the estimator can be measured by the log likelihood ratio LIk(~Ik, 0)
between the MLE estimator and the true parameters in parametric specification,
which is stochastically bounded by the exponential moments (13). In general, ~Ik differs from ^Ik only if a change point is detected at the first k steps. A small value of the likelihood ratio means that ^Ik belongs to the confidence set based on the estimate of ~Ik, i.e. statistically we accept ^Ik = ~Ik. If the procedure stops at some
k  K by a false alarm, i.e. a change point is detected in interval Ik with the adaptive estimator ^Ik, then the accuracy of the estimator can be expressed

E0 |LIk (~Ik , ^Ik )|r   r(0)

(14)

which is to be referred as the "propagation" condition. We choose the critical value

zl based on (14). The situation at the first k steps can be distinguished into two cases. One is that a change point is detected at some step l  k, otherwise there is

no change point in the first k intervals. We denote by Bl the event of rejection at step l, that is,

Bl = {T1  z1, · · · , Tl-1  zl-1, Tl > zl}

(15)

and ^Ik = ~Il-1 on Bl, l = 1, 2, · · · , k. We choose z1 by minimizing the following equation:

max
k=1,··· ,K

E0

|L(~Ik ,

~I0 )|r 1(B1)



Rr(0)/K

9

For zl, l  2, We use the same algorithm to calculate them. The event Bl only depends on z1, · · · , zl. Since z1, · · · , zl-1 have been fixed by previous steps, the event Bl is controlled by zl. Hence, the minimal value of zl should ensure

max
kl

E0

|mkK(~k,

~l-1 )|r 1(Bl )

=

Rr(0)/K

(16)

or we can express the criteria via the log likelihood ratio:

max
kl

E0

|L(~Ik ,

~Il-1 )|r1(Bl)

=

Rr(0)/K

(17)

where  and r are two global parameters, and mk denotes the number of points in Ik. The role of  is similar to the level of the test in the hypothesis testing problem, while r describes the power of the loss function. We apply r = 1/2 in both the

simulation and the real data analysis, since it makes the procedure more stable and

robust against outliers. We also choose  = 0.2, however other values in the range

[0.1, 1] leads to similar results, see Spokoiny (2009).

The critical value zl which satisfies (17) can be found numerically by Monte Carlo simulations from the parametric model. It is a decreasing function with respect to the log length of interval. When the interval is small, it is easier to accept it as the time homogeneous interval, since there are not many jumps due to the short interval, while if we increase the length of interval, as the sample size increases, it contains more uncertain information, especially when big jumps or visible structural changes exist in the interval, therefore it tends to reject the homogeneous interval test statistics for larger interval, correspondingly the critical value should decrease.

The length of the intervals is assumed to geometrically increase with mk = [m0ak]. m0 is the initial length of I0, which is time homogeneous as default. a can be chosen from 1.1 to 1.3. However, the experiments reveal that the results are not sensitive to the choice of a. In the time varying CIR model, three parameters need to be estimated. To guarantee a reasonable quality of the estimation, large sample size is required. Therefore, we choose the length of the initial interval I0 as m0 = 40 and also choose a = 1.25. As already discussed, the interest rates are influenced by macroeconomic variables, and may also be subject to regime shifts. Therefore the longest interval we choose should cover one regime, and at least one change point will exist between the expansion and recession regimes. Referring to a business cycle of around 4 years, we choose the number of intervals K = 15, so that mK = 1136 is the longest tested time homogeneous interval used in both simulation and empirical exercises in this paper.

3.5 "Oracle" Property of The Estimators

In this section, we discuss the "oracle" properties of the LPA estimators. Recall that for the "oracle" choice k, (12) holds, and it also holds for every k  k, while it does not hold for any k  k. The "oracle" choice Ik and Ik are of course unknown. The LPA algorithm tries to mimic this oracle value. In C´izek, Ha¨rdle and Spokoiny
(2009), it is proved that under the SMB condition, the "oracle" property of the LPA estimator ^Ik^ satisfies the following property:

For    and let maxkk E |L(~Ik , )|r1(B1)  Rr(), one has: E log{1 + |LIk (~Ik , )|r }  1 +  Rr()

(18)

Further, we can obtain

E log{1 + |LIk (~Ik , ^Ik^)|r }   +  Rr()

(19)

This theorem tells us that although the false alarm occurs before the "oracle" choice, i.e. k^  k, under the SMB condition, the adaptive estimator ^Ik^ does not go far from the oracle value, which implies the LPA estimator does not induce large errors
into the estimations.

The SMB condition doesn't hold if k^ > k, which means the detected interval is
bigger than the "oracle" interval. However, the LPA estimator ^Ik^ satisfies Theorem 4.3 in C´izek, Ha¨rdle and Spokoiny (2009):

Let E Ik()   for k  K, then LIk (~Ik , ^)1(k^  k)  zk,

E log{1 + |LIk (~Ik , ^Ik^ )|r }   +  + log{1 + zrk }

Rr()

Rr()

(20)

It means ^Ik^ belongs with a high probability to the confidence interval of the oracle estimate ~Ik , i.e. it is still a reliable approximation for the oracle value Ik .

see that for the mean reversion speed a, the LPA under the null contains the true parameter.
Figure 3 presents the performance of the LPA estimator ^b. Its performance is reasonable. One can obviously detect there are two jump points, which respectively locate around time point 300 and 800. Taking the delay time into consideration, the performance of ^b coincides with the true process.
It is worth noting that the performance of the LPA estimator ^ is preferable to that of a^ and ^b. The structural break points is obvious in Figure 4. Both the mean value and the confidence intervals have the same trend as the true parameter path, which indicates the LPA can capture more precise information for volatilities.
Figure 5 depicts the selected longest time homogeneous interval for each time point. One can compare the selected homogeneous intervals with the LPA estimators, all of which provide evidence for the performance of the LPA. In the initial setting, we have two jumps respectively at 250, and 750. It is obvious in this figure that two jump points locate respectively round 300 and 800. Both the 5%­95% pointwise confidence

5 Empirical Study
5.1 Data Description
We use the three month treasury bill rate from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis as a proxy for the short rate. It has been used frequently in the term structure literatures. The data consists of 2840 daily observations, ranging from 2 January,1998 to 13 May, 2009. The summary statistics are shown in Table 2.
The short rate and its daily change are displayed in Figure 6. Obviously, the volatil-

ity of interest rate is changing over time. Without doubt, there are jumps and break points during the whole period; the interest rate from 1999 to 2001 is little volatile, while from mid 2007 to 2009, the volatility of interest rate is higher than that in other periods. On the basis of the phenomenon we observe from the figure that the variation of interest rate is time varying, we fit the CIR model separately with three different scenarios, the first estimation is using the whole sample, another is with the observations from the beginning of 1998 to the end of July 2007, and the last estimated period is from August 2007 to May 2009. The results are presented in Table 3. All of the three parameters differ significantly during the three different periods. For instance, the speed of mean reversion a^ is around 0.26 when using the whole sample, and it changes to 0.14 with the data from 1998 to 2007, and in the last period, it jumps to 3.69. Similar performance can be detected for the long run mean ^b. Interestingly, for the volatility, it is relative low from 1998 to 2007, while it increases to 0.228 in the last period, which can be verified by Figure 6.
Firstly, we use the moving window estimation to investigate the stability of the coefficients in the CIR model. We specify three different window sizes as l = 250, l = 500, l = 750. Figure 7, 8 and 9 separately presents the moving window estimates a^, ^b and ^. Quite similar performances are illustrated both in a^ and ^b. One

can find that Large variations exist in the process. The moving window estimator a^ with a very large variation is shown in Figure 7. It is not surprising that a^ as in the simulation is very sensitive to the data and the length of interval, even for the window size 750, it is somewhat unstable. Similarly, big jumps exist in ^b. It can be negative at some point, and always fluctuates a lot in the different periods. However, the volatility ^ performs in a much more stable way. It keeps almost the same value except in the last periods, where it jumps to a high volatility level.

For the LPA algorithm, we calculate the critical values from 500 Monte Carlo runs. We simulate the CIR path with different combinations of a^, ^b, ^ which are chosen from the estimators using different subsamples of the real data. The performance of the critical values is described in Figure 10. One can notice, the critical value is a decreasing function with respect to the log length of intervals, which is consistent with the theory mentioned above. Moreover, although we change the parameter settings for the simulation, under the null, there are not very significant differences between the critical values. We therefore choose the critical values based on the combination of the values globally estimated from data, i.e. 0 = (0.2657, 0.0153, 0.0944) .
The test results are shown from Figures 11 to 14. The a^ performs very similarly to the moving window estimators. The interest rate volatility is characterized by a fast mean reverting behaviour reflecting the impact of transient economic shocks, such as central bank announcements of base rate changes. ^b performs volatile in different periods, which is consistent with the behaviour of the length of selected time homogeneous interval, Figure 14. It is stable from 1999 to 2000, while the variation becomes larger in 2001 to 2003. From 2003 to 2007, it turns to be stable again, however in the last part, it reverts to a large variation again.
^ performs relatively stable compared with the other two CIR estimators. We again find three different regimes: from 2001 to 2003, the fluctuation of  is increased; from mid 2007, the variance jumps to a high level, which is also reflected in the

length of the intervals Ik^, Figure 14.
Figure 14 describes the time homogeneous intervals for each time point t, here we evaluate from 1999, and we assume the first year is a time homogeneous interval. We then compare the performance of the LPA with the moving window method.
It is worth noting that the length of the selected time interval has a close relationship with the regimes of the macroeconomy. On one hand, the recession regime induces shorter homogeneous intervals, and on the other hand, the length is extended in blooming periods, where the macroeconomy is in a stable state. Let us first analyze the interest rate before 2001. In that period, the economic activity continued to expand briskly, and the variation was relatively small. We go on to compare the short rate in 2001-2003 with the selected time homogeneous interval. In this period, the US economy went into recession. It was influenced by the terrorist attack on 11 September, 2001, the stock market crash in 2002 and the war in Iraq in 2003, which induced an instable macroeconomy: increased oil prices, overstretched investment, too high productivity. All of these factors led to short selected intervals. From 2004 to 2006, the economy headed towards a stable state again. The selected intervals last longer than before. From 2007, the situation reversed, another global

recession came. Again it can be confirmed by the shorter length of the selected intervals.
Figure 15 depicts the in sample fitting. The data is described by the black line, and the two red dashed lines stand for 10%­90% pointwise confidence intervals from the simulated data, which is the same as calculating the critical values. The blue line is the in sample fitting path with the values estimated by LPA, and the purple one is a randomly selected CIR path from the simulation. One may notice that the LPA estimated sample path matches the real data path very well, i.e. the LPA has an acceptable performance for in sample fitting. The structural break points from the fitted LPA path occur very closely to the real data path.
We further evaluate the forecasting performance of the LPA. We compare the forecasting result with the moving window estimators by means of absolute prediction errors (APE). It is defined over a prediction period horizon H, APE(t) =
hH |rt+h - r^t+h|t|/|H|, where r^t+h|t represents the interest rate prediction by a particular model. Both one-day and ten-day ahead forecasting are considered. Figures 16 to 18 present the performance. In each figure, the left panel stands for the ratio from the forecasting with horizon of one day, and the right panel presents the ten days ahead forecasting. It is clear to see that the LPA performs well especially

in the long horizon forecasting.
First, let us consider the result from one-step ahead forecasting. One sees that, in general, the LPA is more preferable than the moving window estimation. Furthermore, as we increase the moving window size, the variation of the ratio becomes smaller, it is therefore obvious that the LPA performs relatively better, but when the economy is in an unstable state, the LPA for one step forecasting can not perform very precisely.
Next, we discuss the prediction results with the horizon of ten days (i.e. 2 weeks). The results are very interesting. In comparison with one-step forecasting, the variation becomes smaller, and the ratios are more stable. Secondly, the LPA shows a superior prediction performance. It is worthy noting that generally for ten-day ahead forecasting, the LPA outperforms the moving window estimate in the whole period. Additionally, the LPA forecasting performance improves as we compare with longer moving window estimators, because it is not reasonable to assume the parameter remains the same in a long period. The prediction is clearly better no matter if it is in the stable state or in the volatile state, which indicates the proposed LPA method shows advantages of forecasting. Additionally, we can confirm that the moving window estimations can not be valid in long horizon forecasting.
Table 4 summaries the prediction performance for the LPA and moving window (MW) estimations with the forecasting horizon of one day and ten days. We consider the mean of absolute forecasting errors (MAE) for each method. Note that for one-day ahead forecasting, there is no significant difference between the LPA and the MW, and both of their MAE are quite small. However, in ten-day ahead forecasting, the difference becomes huge. The accuracy of the MW decreases a lot compared with the LPA, especially if we increase the window size, it is more obvious.
6 Conclusion
There are both considerable statistical evidence and economic reasons to believe that the short interest rate is not stable. We apply a modern statistical method to describe the dynamics of the short rate. With the simple CIR model, and by the LPA method, we detect structural break points for the interest rate process, which is consistent with the conclusion from the existing literature that the dynamics of

interest rate is not stable. We obtain the time homogenous intervals, which is useful to explain the regime switching point. We also compare our results with the moving window estimators, and the results show that the LPA performs better in both in sample fitting and out of sample forecasting, independent of it being in a stable or unstable period.
