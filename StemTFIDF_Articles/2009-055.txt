Representations for optimal stopping under dynamic monetary utility functionals
Volker Kra¨tschmer and John Schoenmakers
Abstract In this paper we consider the optimal stopping problem for general dynamic monetary utility functionals. Sufficient conditions for the Bellman principle and the existence of optimal stopping times are provided. Particular attention is payed to representations which allow for a numerical treatment in real situations. To this aim, generalizations of standard evaluation methods like policy iteration, dual and consumption based approaches are developed in the context of general dynamic monetary utility functionals. As a result, it turns out that the possibility of a particular generalization depends on specific properties of the utility functional under consideration.
Keywords: monetary utility functionals, optimal stopping, duality, policy iteration.

1 Introduction
Dynamic monetary utility functionals, or DMU functionals for short, can be seen as generalizations of the ordinary conditional expectation, the usual functional which is to be maximized in standard stopping problems, which occur for instance in the theory of pricing of American (Bermudan) options in a complete market. It is well known that in an incomplete market the price of an American option is determined by the so called upper and lower Snell envelope which in turn are obtained via optimal stopping of the reward process with respect to two particular mutually conjugate DMU functionals (cf. e.g. [15]). From an economic point of view, dynamic monetary utility functionals functionals may be seen as representations of dynamic preferences in terms of utilities of financial investors. By changing sign, a DMU functionals becomes a dynamic risk measure (e.g. in [21]) which represents preferences in terms of losses instead of utilities in fact. Therefore, technically, the study of DMU functionals is basically equivalent to the study of dynamic risk measures which became an increasing research field in the last years. A realistic dynamic risk assessment of financial positions should allow for updating as time evolves, taking into account new information. The notion of dynamic risk measures has been

established to provide a proper framework (cf. e.g. [3], [8], [10], [11], [14]). It is based on an axiomatic characterization extending the classical axioms for the concept of one-period risk measures in [2] to the dynamic multiperiod setting. From the very beginning one crucial issue was to find reasonable conditions of mutual relationships between the risk functionals, so-called dynamic consistency, leading to different concepts (cf. e.g. [3], [8], [10], [11], [30], [31], [33], [34]). The mostly used one is often called strict time consistency, and it is linked with a technical condition for dynamic risk measures known as recursiveness. This condition will play an important technical role in our investigations. Recently, dynamic monetary utility functionals (as being dynamic risk measures with changed sign) have been incorporated into different topics such as, for example, the dynamics of indifference prices (see [21], [9]), and the pricing of derivatives in incomplete financial markets (cf. e.g. [30], [15], [28]). In this respect we want to emphasize the contributions in [15] and [28] as being the starting point of this paper. There the superhedging of American options is analyzed as solutions of optimal stopping problems in the context of coherent dynamic monetary utility functionals. We want to extend these considerations to more general monetary utility functionals. For instance, we will not necessarily assume translation invariance which has been recently questioned as a suitable condition for risk assessment since it tacitly supposes certainty on discounting factors by the investors (cf. [13]). Within a time discrete setting we shall look for a minimal set of conditions for the dynamic monetary utility functionals which guarantee solutions for the related optimal stopping problems at different times. For classical stopping problems with respect to ordinary conditional expectations the starting point for any solution representation is the Bellman principle. This suggests to investigate when the Bellman principle holds for the general optimal stopping problems. The above mentioned condition of recursiveness in connection with a specific regularity condition will turn out to be sufficient. Beyond the considerations of the general optimal stopping, the main contribution of this paper is the development of iterative methods and other representations for solving them. Based on these methods we naturally construct simulation based solution algorithms which allow for solving such stopping problems in practice. In contrast to meanwhile industrial standard approaches for Bermudan options, hence the ordinary stopping problem in discrete time (among others, [1], [6], [22], [24], [32]), we have not seen yet a comprehensive generic approach for treating generalized optimal stopping problems numerically. In this respect this paper intends to be a first step in this direction. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the concept of dynamic monetary utility functionals is introduced. In Section 3 we investigate the Bellman principle and the existence of optimal stopping strategies. In Section 4 a generalization of the policy iteration method of [22] is presented. Section 5, Section 6, and Section 7 generalize, respectively, the additive dual method of [29]-[17], the multiplicative dual of [20], and the consumption based approach in [4]-[5]. In Section 8 we shall provide a simulation setting to utilize the results of sections 4-7 to construct approximations of the optimal values of the investigated stopping problems. More technical proofs are given in Appendix A.
2 Dynamic monetary utility functionals
Let , (Ft)t{0,...,T }, F , P be filtered probability space with {0, 1}-valued P |F0, and let X be a real vector subspace of L0(, F, P) containing the indicator mappings 1A of subsets A  F. It is assumed that for any X  X and A  F it holds 1AX  X, A  F. Moreover, for any X, Y  X and it holds X  Y  X and X  Y  X. Hence in particular X is a vector lattice. A family of mappings  := (t)t{0,...,T } with t : X  X  L0(, Ft, P) being monotone, i.e. t(X)  t(Y ) for X, Y  X with X  Y P -a.s.. is called a dynamic monetary utility functional or shortly
2

DMU functional.
We shall say that (t)t{0,...,T } is recursively generated if there is some family (t)t{0,...,T } of mappings t : X  L0(, Ft+1, P)  X  L0(, Ft, P) with FT +1 := F such that

T = T , and t = t  t+1 for t = 0, ..., T - 1.

In this case the mappings t will be given the name generators of (t)t{0,...,T } . Let us introduce some further notations. Henceforth Tt will stand for the set of the finite stopping times
 with   t P -a.s., whereas H will denote the set of adapted processes Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T } such that Zt  X  L0(, Ft, P) for t  {0, ..., T }.
The following conditions on (t)t{0,..,T } will play an important role in the context of optimal stopping of DMU functionals studied later on.

(C1) t(X)  t(Y ) P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T - 1}, X, Y  X with t+1(X)  t+1(Y ) P -a.s. (time consistency).

(C2) t(1AX) = 1At(X) P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T }, A  Ft, and X  X (regularity).
(C3) t(X + Y ) = t(X) + Y P -a.s. for t  {0, ...T }, and X, Y  X with Y being Ft-measurable (conditional translation invariance).

(C4) t = t  t+1 P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T - 1} (recursiveness).
(C5) t(0) = 0 P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T } (normalization).
(C6) t(Y X) = Y t(X) P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T }, X  X and Y  X  L0(, Ft, P) with Y  0 P -a.s. as well as XY  X (conditional positive homogeneity)

(C7) For each X  X with X  0 P -a.s. there exist a function g : [0, )  R+ such that lim0 g() = 0,

and

t (X  )  t (X) + g() for t  {0, ..., T }.

Remark 2.1 In this paper we frequently use one of the following implications. Their proofs are simple and therefore omitted.

· Recursiveness implies that (t)t{0,..,T } is recursively generated, where the generators are the restrictions t|X  L0(, Ft+1, P) for t = 0, ..., T.
· Let (t)t{0,..,T } be recursively generated by (t)t{0,..,T }. Then,
­ If t(X) = X P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T } and X  XL0(, Ft, P), then (t)t{0,..,T } is recursive. ­ If t(X) = X P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T } and X  X  L0(, Ft, P), then (t)t{0,..,T } is
recursive.
­ iii) If for any X  X and A  Ft it holds t(1AX) = 1At(X), then  is regular.

Example 2.2 The functional  given by the conditional expectations t := E[· | Ft] is a basic example for a DMU functional. It satisfies all the conditions (C1)-(C7).

It is natural to generalize the usual martingale concept to the notion of "-martingale" for a given DMU functional  as defined below. The notion of -martingales will be used for different representations of optimal stopping problems in Sections 5,6.

Definition 2.3 M := (Mt)t{0,...,T }  H is aid to be a -martingale if t(Mt+1) = Mt P -a.s. for every t  {0, ..., T - 1}. Note that for recursive , M  H is a -martingale if and only if t(Ms) = Mt P -a.s. for every s, t  {0, ..., T - 1} with s > t.
Let us discuss some further examples of DMU functionals. First of all we want to consider the relationship with the so called dynamic risk measures.

Example 2.4 DMU functionals may be viewed as generalizations of dynamic risk measures. Recall, a family (t)t{0,...,T } is a dynamic risk measure if and only if (-t)t{0,...,T } is a conditionally translation invariant monetary utility functional. The property of translation invariance suggests to restrict considerations to normalized functionals because of t(X -t(X)) = 0. In the normalized case t(Y ) = Y P -a.s. for every t  {0, ..., T } and any Y  X  L0(, Ft, P), and in view of Remark 2.1  is recursively generated if and only if it is recursive. We shall call the normalized conditional translation invariant  to be convex/concave if the mappings t (t  {0, ..., T }) are simultaneously convex/concave. If  is convex/concave, then
t : X  X  L0(, Ft, P), X  -t(-X)

defines a concave/convex normalized conditional translation invariant DMU functional called the conju-

gate of . The conditions of recursiveness and regularity are satisfied by  if and only its conjugate 

fulfills them. Conditional translation invariance of convex/concave  implies the regularity condition for

the restriction of  to XL(, F, P) (cf. [21], where this restriction is essential for the proof). Moreover,

and any nonnegative X  X. Indeed, one may conclude from Lemma 6.5 in [23] that

t(X) = ess inf ess sup t(X+  n - X-  m)
mN nN
holds for t  {0, ..., T } and X  X. In the context of dynamic risk measures the property of recursiveness plays an important role. On the one hand it is intimately linked with the property of time consistency which has a specific meaning in expressing dynamic preferences of investors. For a thorough study the reader may consult e.g. [14] or [3]. On the other hand optimal stopping with dynamic risk measures may be related to specific financial applications.

The next large class of DMU functionals concerns the so called g-expectations. They are prominent examples of nonlinear functionals satisfying martingale type properties like recursiveness.

Example 2.5 Let (Gs)s0 be the augmented filtration on  associated with the filtration generated by a standard d-dimensional Brownian motion (Bs)s0 with B0 := 0, and let for S > 0 the function g :  × [0, S] × R × Rd  R satisfy
(i) There is some constant C > 0 such that

|g(·, t, y1, z1) - g(·, t, y2, z2)|  C (|y1 - y2| + z1 - z2 ) P -a.s.
for every t  [0, S] and arbitrary (y1, z1), (y2, z2)  R × Rd, where · denotes an arbitrary norm on Rd;

4

(ii) (g(·, s, y, z))s[0,S] is an adapted P -square integrable process for (y, z)  R × Rd; (iii) g(·, s, y, 0) = 0 P -a.s. for s  [0, S] and y  R. Such a function g can be used as driver of a backward stochastic differential equation (abbreviated: BSDE)

SS
Ys = X + g(·, r, Yr, Zr) dr - Zr dBr for s  [0, S],
ss
where X  L2(, GS, P). As shown is [25] there always exists a unique couple YsX s[0,S] and ZsX s[0,S] of adapted respectively 1- and d-dimensional processes satisfying

and solving the BSDE. Now it is natural to define the family (Eg[·|Gs])s[0,S] via

Eg[· | Gs] : L2(, GS, P)  L2(, Gs, P), X  YsX ,

known as (a family of) conditional g-expectations, where Eg[· | G0] is just called g-expectation. For g  0 we retrieve the usual (conditional) expectation of a square integrable random variable. For
applications of conditional g-expectations in finance the reader is referred to [12] and [26].
Let us now pick some observation times 0 =: s0 < s1 < ... < sT := S, and define , (Ft)t{0,...,T }, F , P and  := (t)t{0,...,T } by Ft := Gst , F := FT , and t := Eg[· | Gst ]. Drawing on basic properties of conditional g-expectation as derived by Peng in [25],  is always a regular recursive DMU functional
fulfilling t(X) = X P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T } and Ft-measurable X. Furthermore  is conditional translation invariant if and only if g(, s, ·, z) is constant for every   , s  [0, S] and z  Rd (for the if part see [25], for the only if part cf. [19]). In this case  is even a
convex normalized conditionally translation invariant DMU functional if and only if in addition

g(·, ·, ·, z1 + (1 - )z2)  g(·, ·, ·, z1) + (1 - )g(·, ·, ·, z2) P dt - a.s. for z1, z2  Rd and   [0, 1] (cf. [19]). We shall finish the section with some nonstandard examples. Examples 2.6 Let X = L(, F , P).

1. For strictly increasing U1, ..., UK : R  R with U1(0) = ... = UK (0) = 0 and positive 1, ..., K , let  be recursively generated with generators (t)t{0,...,T } defined by

K
t(X) := kUk-1 (EP[Uk(X) | Ft]) for t  {0, ..., T } and X  L(, Ft, P).
k=1
K
Obviously the functional  is regular. Moreover, if k = 1, it satisfies t(X) = X P -a.s. for
k=1
t  {0, ..., T } and X  L(, Ft, P), hence  is recursive. In the case of K = 1 = 1, t is defined in literally the same way as its generator t.

2. For nonvoid sets Q1, ..., QK of probability measures on F which are equivalent with P, and positive 1, ..., K , let  be recursively with generators (t)t{0,...,T } defined by

K

t(X) := k ess sup EQ[X|Ft] for t  {0, ..., T }.

k=1

QQk

Similar as in the previous example  is regular by construction, and is recursive if in addition
K
1 = 1. Further,  is conditionally translation invariant, conditionally positively homogeneous,
k=1
and convex. Moreover, if K = 1 = 1, and if the set Q1 is stable under pasting (see [15] for the
concept), t is defined in literally the same way as its generator t (cf. [15], Theorem 6.53).

3 The optimal stopping problem

We will study the following stopping problem

Yt := ess sup t(Z ), t  {0, ..., T },
 Tt

(2)

for Z  H. We refer to the process Y  as the (-)Snell envelope of Z. Below we consider two important aspects. Firstly, we investigate the existence of optimal stopping times and secondly, we try to find Bellman principles. The crucial step to guarantee optimal stopping times is provided by thHorst, U*e following Lemma.

Lemma 3.1 Let Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T }  H, let for some fixed t  {0, ..., T - 1} exist some t+1  Tt+1

such

that

t+1(Zt+1 )

=

ess sup t+1(Z ).
 Tt+1

Defining

the

event

Bt

:=

t(Zt) - t(Zi+1 )  0

and t :=

t1Bt + i+11\Bt , we obtain Bt  Ft, t  Tt, and under the conditions of time consistency and regularity

t (Z t )

=

ess sup
 Tt

t(Z

)

=

t(Zt)



t(Zt+1 ).

Proof: Bt  Ft, t  Tt follows from Ft-measurability of the outcomes of t. Furthermore we may observe Zt = 1Bt Zt + 1\Bt Zi+1 . Then the application of (C1) yields

t(Zt )

=

1Bt t(Zt )

+

1\Bt t(Zt )

(C 2)
=

(1Bt Zt)

+

(1\Bt Zt+1 )

(C2)
=

1Bt t(Zt)

+

1\Bt t(Zt+1 )

= t(Zt)  t(Zt+1 ).

Next let us define the mapping  : Tt  Tt+1 by ( ) := (t + 1)1[=t] +  1[>t]. Then we obtain for   Tt

t(Z ) = t(1[=t]Zt + 1[>t]Z()) (C=2) 1[=t]t(Zt) + 1[>t]t(Z())  t(Zt)  t(Z()).

By assumption t+1(Z())  t+1(Zt+1 ) P -a.s. so that condition (C1) implies

P
t(Z )  t(Zt)  t(Z())  t(Zt)  t(Zt+1 ) = t(Zt ), which completes the proof.

6

Since  : T is always the optimal stopping time in FT , we may apply sequentially Lemma 3.1 to obtain the following result concerning the existence of optimal stopping times.

Theorem 3.2 Let Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T }  H. Then under conditions of time consistency and regularity there exists for any t  {0, ..., T } some t  Tt such that

t(Zt )

=

ess sup
 Tt

t(Zt).

The sequence (t)t{0,...,T } of optimal stopping times may be chosen such that T = T, and

1[t>t]t = 1[t>t]t+1 for any t  {0, ..., T - 1}.

Let us now turn over to recursively generated DMU functionals.

Corollary 3.3 Let (t)t{0,...,T } be recursively generated with generators (t)t{0,...,T } satisfying the property t(X)  t(Y ) P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T -1} and X, Y  X L0(, Ft+1, P) with X  Y P -a.s..
Then Theorem 3.2 may be restated under regularity only.

Proof: The assumptions on the generators (t)t{0,...,T } imply the time consistency condition (C1).

In order to construct optimal stopping times a recursive relationship between the optimal values of the
stopping problems at different dates will turn out to be very useful. For this reason we shall restrict
ourselves to recursively generated DMU functionals generated by the functionals (t)t{0,...,T } . The following theorem is a direct consequence of Lemma 3.1 and Corollary 3.3.

Theorem 3.4 Let (t)t{0,...,T } be regular and recursively generated with generators satisfying the property t(X)  t(Y ) P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T - 1} and X, Y  X  L0(, Ft+1, P) with X  Y P -a.s.
Then we have the Bellman principle: It holds:

ess sup t(Z ) = t(Zt)  t ess sup t+1(Z)

 Tt

Tt+1

for any Z  H and every t  {0, ..., T - 1}.

For a recursive DMU functional (t)t{0,...,T } the generators are just the restrictions t|XL0(, Ft+1, P) for t  {0, ..., T - 1}, and the Bellman principle may be strengthened in the following way.

Corollary 3.5 Let (t)t{0,...,T } be a DMU functional which is regular and recursive, and whose generators t|X  L0(, Ft+1, P), t  {0, ..., T - 1}, satisfy the monotonicity assumption in Corollary 3.3. It
then holds,

ess sup t(Z ) = t(Zt)  t ess sup t+1(Z)

 Tt

Tt+1

for any Z  H and every t  {0, ..., T - 1}.

Example 3.6 Let us consider the issue of pricing and hedging American contingent claims in an incom-
plete arbitrage free financial market with reference probability measure P and the set Q of equivalent
martingale measures, and let X consist of all X  L0(, F , P) such that sup EQ[|X|] < . Then the

are recursive (e.g. see [15], Proposition 6.45, Theorem 6.53) and play a key role in the following sense: For any Z  H the stopping problems (2) according to  and  correspond to the upper and lower Snell envelopes of Z w.r.t. Q respectively. Moreover, the initial value of the lower and upper snell envelope are just the lower and upper hedging price, respectively. Further, the optimal stopping time according to the lower hedging prices corresponds to optimal exercise strategy for the buyer of the option. For details see for example [15], Theorems 7.13, 7.14.

Example 3.7 Let  be a finite subfamily of conditional g-expectations. Then in view of Example 2.5 combined with Corollaries 3.3, 3.5 we may find for any Z  H some family (t)t{0,...,T } of stopping times t  Tt satisfying T = T as well as 1[t>t]t = 1[t>t]t+1, and

t(Z ) = ess sup t(Z ) = t(Zt)  t
 Tt

ess sup t+1(Z )
 Tt+1

= t(Zt)  t(Zt+1 )

for t  {0, ..., T - 1}.

Example 3.8 The DMU functionals introduced in Examples 2.6 admit families of optimal stopping times as in Corollary 3.3 and satisfy the Bellman principle due to Theorem 3.4.

4 Iterative solution of optimal stopping problems

Throughout this section we fix a recursively generated regular DMU functional (t)t{0,...,T } with gener-
ators (t)t{0,...,T } satisfying t(X)  t(Y ) P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T } and X, Y  X  L0(, Ft+1, P) with X  Y P -a.s.. Then in view of Corollary 3.3, for any Z  H there exists a family (t)t{0,...,T } of stopping times t  Tt with

T = T, and 1[t>t]t = 1[t>t]t+1 for any t  {0, ..., T - 1},

(3)

such that

Yt

=

ess sup t(Z )
 Tt

=

t(Zt )

for

every

t



{0, ...,

T }.

(4)

Our goal is to develop an iterative procedure which converges to (4). In fact we shall generalize the policy iteration method in [22] for classical optimal stopping with conditional expectations to optimal stopping of regular recursive DMU functionals. Let us define (t)t{0,...,T } to be a time consistent stopping family if

t  Tt, T = T, and 1[t>t]t = 1[t>t]t+1 for t  {0, ..., T - 1}.

8

The policy iteration step starts with any time consistent stopping family (t)t{0,...,T } and corresponding process (Yt)t{0,...,T } with Yt := t(Zt ), being an approximation of (Yt)t{0,...,T } . In order to improve
this approximation we consider the process Yt t{0,...,T } defined by Yt := maxtsT t(Zs ), and the new stopping family

T := T,

t

:=

inf {s



{t, ...,

T}

|

s(Zs)



max
s+1uT

s(Zu )},

0  t  T - 1.

(5)

Obviously, the stopping family (^t)t{0,...,T } is also time consistent . By the next theorem, a generalization of Theorem 3.1 in [22] in fact, the process Yt t{0,...,T } , defined by Yt := t(Z^t ), improves the initial approximation (Yt)t{0,...,T } of (4).
Theorem 4.1 We have the inequalities

Yt  Yt  Yt  Yt, t  {0, ..., T }.
The proof of Theorem 4.1 is similar to the proof in [22]. However, it has to be focussed that it is sufficient that the DMU functional under consideration is regular and recursively generated. For the convenience of the reader the proof is therefore provided in Appendix A (while also comprising the structure of argumentation in [22] slightly). In view of Theorem 4.1 the idea is to construct recursively a sequence of pairs

(t(m))t{0,...,T }, (Yt(m))t{0,...,T } mN0

where (t(m))t{0,...,T } is a time consistent stopping family for any m  N0 such that Yt(m) = t(Zt(m) ),

and

t(m+1)

=

inf {s



{t,

...,

T}

|

s(Zs)



max
s+1uT

s(Zu(m) )}

for

t



{0, ..., T

-

1}.

Next we start with some time consistent stopping family (t(0))t{0,...,T }, for example, a canonical choice is t0 := t. Then due to Theorem 4.1, we have

Yt(0)  Yt(m)  Yt(m+1)  Yt(m+1)  Yt for m  N0, t  {0, ..., T },

(6)

where

Yt(m+1)

:=

max
tsT

t(Zs(m) ).

The iteration procedure may be stopped after at most T iterations, yielding an optimal stopping family.

Proposition 4.2 For t  {0, ..., T } we have

Yt(m) = Yt if m  T - t.
Hence t(m) is an optimal stopping time for the corresponding stopping problem at time t, if m  T - t, and in particular (t(m))t{0,...,T } is an optimal stopping family for m  T.
Proof: The proof may be done by adapting the proof of Proposition 4.4 in [22] in a similar way as is done for proving Theorem 4.1 and therefore omitted. Indeed, a closer inspection of the proof of Proposition 4.4 (in [22]) shows that only regularity, the fact that the DMU functional is recursively generated by a monotonic system (t), and the Bellman principle (see Theorem 3.4) is essential.

Examples 4.3
1. Referring to Example 3.6, Proposition 4.2 guarantees that the proposed iteration method provides a scheme to calculate super hedging prices and optimal exercises of discounted American options.
2. In view of Example 2.5 and Examples 2.6 the associated stopping problems may be solved iteratively by the introduced method. In particular we have a numerical scheme for optimal stopping with gexpectations.

5 Additive dual upper bounds

In this section the DMU functional  is assumed to be regular, conditional translation invariant, and recursive. In fact, regularity implies normalization (take A = ), which implies by conditional translation invariance t(Z) = Z for Ft-measurable Z, hence recursiveness. For clearness we will underline recursiveness nonetheless. For such a  we propose an additive dual representation for the stopping problem (2), in terms of -martingales introduced in Definition 2.3. As such this generalization may be seen as a generalization of the representation of [29], and [17] for the standard stopping problem. We first extend the classical additive Doob decomposition theorem.

Lemma 5.1 Let  be a regular, conditional translation invariant, and recursive DMU functional. Then for any Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T }  H there exists a unique pair (M, A)  H × H of a -martingale M and a predictable process A, such that M0 = A0 = 0, and

Zt = Z0 + Mt + At for t  {0, ..., T }, P -a.s.

Proof: Define A recursively by A0 := 0, and At+1 := At + t(Zt+1) - Zt for t  {0, ..., T - 1}. Then of course A  H and A is predictable. Next define M  H via Mt := Zt - Z0 - At for t  {0, ..., T }. Obviously M0 = 0, and by conditional translation invariance (property (C3)),

t(Mt+1) =3) t(Zt+1) - Z0 - At+1 = t(Zt+1) - Z0 - (At + t(Zt+1) - Zt) = Zt - Z0 - At = Mt.

So M is a -martingale and (7) holds. Now let (M , A )  H × H be another pair as stated. Then for t  {0, ..., T - 1} we may conclude by conditional translation invariance,

0 = t(Mt+1 - Mt) = t(Zt+1) - Zt + At - At+1,
in particular At+1 = At + t(Zt+1) - Zt. Hence by induction A = A, and so M = M.
The next lemma may be regarded as a generalization of Doob's optional sampling theorem. It is proved in Appendix A.
Lemma 5.2 Let  be a regular, conditional translation invariant, and recursive DMU functional, and let M be any -martingale. Then for every Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T }  H, each t  {0, ..., T }, and each stopping time   Tt, we have
t(Z ) = t(Z + MT - M ).

Remark 5.3 Under the assumptions of Lemma 5.2 the statement
t(Z ) = t(Z + M ) - Mt,
that one might expect at a first glance, does not hold.
The Doob type Lemmas 5.1,5.2, and the Bellman principle Theorem 3.4, provide the ingredients to establish the following additive dual representation.
Theorem 5.4 Let  be a regular, conditional translation invariant, and recursive DMU functional, and M0 be the set of all -martingales M with M0 = 0. For Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T }  H let M   M0 be the -martingale of the decomposition of Y  in (2) according to Lemma 5.1. Then

Proof: Let A := (At)t{0,...,T } denote the predictable part of the decomposition of Y  according to Lemma 5.1. Since M  is a -martingale, we have for t  {0, ..., T }

0 = t(Mt+1) - Mt (C=3) t(Mt+1 - Mt) (C=3) t(Yt+1) - Yt - At+1 - At .
This implies At+1 - At = t(Yt+1) - Yt  0 due to the Bellman principle. Hence A has nonincreasing paths. Furthermore, by the Bellman principle t(Zt) = Zt  Yt holds for every t  {0, ..., T }. We thus have
Zt - Mt + MT = Zt + YT - Yt + At - AT  YT + At - AT for t  {0, ....T }.
Since A is nonincreasing,  is conditional translation invariant and recursive, and M  is a -martingale, it follows that

Examples 5.6 Theorem 5.4 may be applied immediately to the following regular, translation invariant, and recursive functionals (see also Remark 2.1).
1. Let  be a family of g-expectations as in Example 2.5 with driver g :  × [0, S] × R × Rd  R such that g(, s, ·, z) is constant for (, s, z)   × [0, S] × Rd.

6 Multiplicative dual upper bounds

The additive dual representation for the standard stopping problem has a multiplicative version which is due to [20]. We will develop in this section a multiplicative dual representation for the stopping problem (2) when the DMU functional  is recursive and positively homogeneous. Note that from any positively homogeneous recursively generated DMU functional we may obtain a recursive one, by multiplication with a constant. To our aim we need an extension of the multiplicative Doob decomposition theorem. As we do not want to burden the presentation with too much technicalities, we restrict our selves in this section to the case where X = L(, F , P).

Lemma 6.1 Let  := (t)t{0,...,T } be a positively homogeneous recursive DMU functional. Let  > 0, and Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T }  H with Zt   P -a.s. for any t  {0, ..., T }. Then there exists a unique pair (N, U )  H × H of some -martingale N and a predictable process U such that N0 = U0 = 1 and

Zt = Z0NtUt P a.s.

for t  {0, ..., T }.

Proof: Define processes U and N recursively by U0 := N0 := 1 and

Ut+1 := Ut

t(Zt+1) , Zt

Nt+1

:= Nt

Zt+1 t(Zt+1)

for

t  {0, ..., T

- 1}.

Observe that U and N are well defined since by assumption t(Zt)  t() =  due to monotonicity of . Obviously, U is predictable, N is a -martingale, and it follows easily by induction that Zt = Z0NtUt for all t  {0, ..., T }.
Now let (N , U )  H × H be another pair as stated. We will show that Nt = Nt, Ut = Ut P -a.s. for t  {0, ..., T } by induction. The case t = 0 is trivial. So let t  {0, ..., T - 1} such that Nt = Nt, Ut =

12

Ut P -a.s.. Firstly, t(Nt+1) = Nt = Nt = t(Nt+1) P -a.s. since N, N are -martingales. Therefore by conditional positive homogeneity (C6)

(C 6)

(C6)

Z0Ut+1Nt = Z0Ut+1t(Nt+1) = t(Zt+1) = Z0Ut+1t(Nt+1) = Z0Ut+1Nt.

Thus Ut+1 = Ut+1 P -a.s. due to Z0Nt > 0 P -a.s., and

Z0Ut+1Nt+1 = Zt+1 = Z0Ut+1Nt+1 = Z0Ut+1Nt+1 P -a.s..

Since Z0Ut+1 > 0 P -a.s. we have Nt+1 = Nt+1 P -a.s.

The next Lemma is a multiplicative version of Lemma 5.2. For a proof see Appendix A.

Lemma 6.2 Let  := (t)t{0,...,T } be a positively homogeneous recursive DMU functional, and let Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T }  H with Zt  0 P -a.s. for any t  {0, ..., T }. If N := (Nt)t{0,...,T } denotes any -martingale satisfying Nt > 0 P -a.s., then

t(Z ) = t

Z NT N

for t  {0, ..., T } and   Tt.

Obviously, under the assumptions of this section  satisfies the Bellman principle (see Theorem 3.4), which allows us to establish a multiplicative dual representation for the stopping problem (2).

Theorem 6.3 Let the DMU functional  be as in Lemma 6.1, let M+1 be the set of all -martingales N with N > 0 and N0 = 1, and let Z  H with Z  0. We then may state for every t  {0, ..., T } the
following:

(i)

Yt

=

ess sup t(Z )
 Tt



inf
N M+1

t

max ZjNT tjT Nj

.

(ii) If  satisfies in addition condition (C7), we have

(iii) If Z is as in Lemma 6.1 we have

Yt

=

ess inf t
N M+1

max
tjT

Zj NT Nj

= t

max
tjT

Zj NT Nj

,

where N   M0 is the -martingale in the multiplicative decomposition of Y  in (6.1).
Proof: Statement (i) is an immediate consequence of Lemma 6.2. For the proof of statement (ii) let us consider an arbitrary  > 0. The process Z, defined by Zt := Zt   induces the process Y  via Yt := ess sup t(Z) which fulfills the assumptions of Lemma 6.1. Therefore
 Tt

13

we may find a pair (U , N ) consisting of a predictable process U  and a -martingale N   M+1 satisfying
Yt = Y0NtUt P a.s. for t  {0, ..., T }.
Due to conditional positive homogeneity of , the predictability of U , and since N  is a -martingale we may conclude

1 = t

Nt+1 Nt

= t

Yt+1Ut YtUt+1

=

Ut Ut+1

t(Yt+1) Yt

for

t



{0, ..., T

- 1}.

In view of the Bellman principle this implies

Ut+1 Ut

=

t(Yt+1) Yt



1

for

t



{0, ..., T

- 1}.

Hence U  has nonincreasing paths. Furthermore Zt = t(Zt) and so in particular, Zt  Yt due to the Bellman principle. Combining, we obtain for t  {0, ..., T },

t

ZjNT Nj



t

YjNT Uj

(9)

Now let a common function g satisfy (1) in condition (C7) for all Zj, j = 0, ..., T. By regularity and condition (C7) it then holds

TT

Yt := ess sup 1[=j]t(Z) = ess sup 1[=j]t(Zj)

 Tt j=t

 Tt j=t

T
 ess sup 1[=j] (t(Zj) + g()) = Yt + g().
 Tt j=t

Hence with (9) we obtain

Yt

t

(i)
 Yt for every t  {0, ..., T }.

The proof of (ii) is completed by sending   0. Now let Z and  > 0 be as in Lemma 6.1 and take  such that 0 <  < . We so have Z = Z and then statement (iii) follows from statement (i) and using (9) in the proof of (ii) (which holds independently of condition (C7)).

Examples 6.4 Theorem 6.3 may be applied in the following situations.
1. Let Q denote the set of equivalent martingale measures w.r.t. some arbitrage-free financial market, and let Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T } be a nonnegative adaptive process satisfying sup sup EQ[Zt] < .
t{0,...,T } QQ

14

The process Z may be viewed as a discounted American Option with respect to the recursive
conditional positive homogeneous DMU functional t(·) := ess sup EQ[· | Ft]. Furthermore, let us
QQ
denote by X+1 the set of X  L(, FT , P) with X > 0 P -a.s. such that sup EQ[X] = 1. Then
QQ
the superhedging price and the lowest arbitrage-free price of Z may be represented by

max ZtX t{0,...,T } t(X )

and

inf 0
X X+1

max ZtX t{0,...,T } t(X )

,

respectively (see also Example 5.5).

2. As another application of Theorem 6.3 we may consider the DMU functionals in Examples 2.6, 2, since they are obviously recursive and positively homogeneous.

7 Consumption based representation

Throughout this section,  is a regular conditional translation invariant recursive DMU functional. For such a functional we will propose a representation for the stopping problem (2) which can be seen as generalization of the consumption upper bound in [4] and [5]. Due to the fact that  satisfies the Bellman principle we can proof the following theorem.

Theorem 7.1 For any Z  H we have


T -1



Yt := ess sup t(Z ) = t ZT + (Zj - j(Yj+1))+ ,

 Tt

j=t

t  {0, ..., T },

with empty sums being defined zero.

Proof: We shall proceed by backward induction over t. The case t = T is trivial. So let us assume for any
T -1
t  {1, ..., T } that Yt = t ZT + (Zj - j(Yj+1))+ is valid. Then due to Bellman principle Yt-1 =
j=t
(Zt-1 - t-1(Yt))+ + t-1 (Yt) , which implies by assumption and recursiveness property (C4)



T -1



Yt-1 = (Zt-1 - t-1(Yt))+ + t-1 t ZT + (Zj - j (Yj+1))+

j=t


T -1



= (Zt-1 - t-1(Yt))+ + t-1 ZT + (Zj - j (Yj+1))+

j=t

Then the application of conditional translation invariance yields


T -1
Yt-1 = t-1 (Zt-1 - t-1(Yt))+ + ZT + (Zj - j (Yj+1))+
j=t


T -1



= t-1 ZT +

(Zj - j (Yj+1))+ ,

j=t-1

15

which completes the proof. The interesting feature of the representation in Theorem 7.1 is that if we replace Y  on the right-hand-side by a lower (upper) approximation we obtain an upper (lower) bound for Y  on the left-hand-side.
8 Numerical approaches for optimal stopping of some specific DMU functionals
In this section we sketch how the different representations developed in Sections 4-7 may be utilized for constructing (upper and/or lower) approximations of the of the optimal value of stopping problem (2). In order to enable a feasible algorithm or simulation procedure for optimal stopping of a particular DMU functional we naturally presume that we have a feasible algorithm or simulation procedure for the functional itself at hand. In this respect we underline that numerical (simulation) methods for specific DMU functionals is an interesting issue in it's own right but considered to be beyond the scope of this article. Another natural assumption is that we have some underlying process with some kind of Markovian structure which can be simulated straightforwardly. More specifically, we assume that we are in the following setting.
Setting for solving general optimal stopping problems by simulation
i) The filtration (Ft)t{0,...,T } is generated by some underlying stochastic process S := (St)t{0,...,T } in some multi-dimensional state space, e.g. Rd.
ii) The process Z := (Zt)t{0,...,T } under consideration satisfies Zt = h(t, St) for some known nonnegative measurable function h. For ease of exposition, h is assumed to be bounded.
iii) The DMU functional  = (t)t{0,...,T } is regular, recursively generated by (t)t{0,...,T } with generators satisfying t(X) = X if X  Ft, for any t  {0, ..., T }. Hence in particular  is recursive with t(X) = X of X  Ft for t  {0, ..., T }.
iv) For any t  {0, ..., T } we have t(X) being {St}-measurable if X is {St, ...ST }-measurable (We might think of S being Markovian w.r.t. the functional ). This condition is e.g. guaranteed in the case that for any u, t  {0, ..., T } with u  t we have t(X) is {Su, ..., St}-measurable whenever X is {Su, ..., St+1}-measurable.
v) For any t  {0, ..., T }, we may compute t(X)  {St} if X  {St, ...ST } by some kind of simulation method.
In the standard case, where  represents the ordinary conditional expectation and S is Markovian in the ordinary sense, iii), iv), and v) are obviously fulfilled. A canonical way of evaluating conditional expectations is (Monte Carlo) simulation from a particular state (t, St) (particularly in higher dimensions). In general there are many interesting examples, for instance, within the class of g-expectations:
Example 8.1 Let  be a family of g-expectations as in example 2.5 with Brownian motion B = (Bs)s0 and driver g : ×[0, S]×R×Rn  R being of the form g(, s, y, z) := f (Ss, y, z). Here f : Rn ×R×Rd  R is any Lipschitz function with f (·, 0)  0, and (Ss)s0 is an n-dimensional diffusion process with dynamics given by the SDE,
dSs = µ(Ss) dt + (Ss) dBs.
16

Under some further conditions of regularity for µ,  and f, it may be verified that  satisfies assumption iv) (cf. [18], Theorem 6.2). Furthermore simulation algorithms as required in assumption v) are already available (see e.g. [16], [27]). Moreover, if f does not depend on y, and is sublinear in z, then there is some set Q of probability measures which are absolutely continuous w.r.t. P such that  admits the following robust representation
t(X) = ess sup EQ [X | {S1, ..., St}] ,
QQ
where the essential supremum is attained (see [7], proof of Theorem 3.1).
Below we will outline the implementation of the above simulation setting for different solution representations proposed in Sections 4-7.

Policy iteration

The policy iteration method in Section 4 may be readily applied if the time consistent stopping family
(t) we start with is such that {t = t}  {St}. For example we just take the trivial family t = t, t  {0, ..., T }. Then the iteration procedure will be analogue to the one spelled out in [22]. In short, given an input stopping family (t), simulate a set of N (outer) trajectories S(n), n = 1, ..., N, from t = 0 to T. Determine on each outer trajectory S(n), the improved stopping time 0. For this, one needs to simulate for each time s = 0, 1, .. a set of M (inner) trajectories (mSu(n))u=s,...,T , m = 1, ..., M to check by simulation
whether the event

s(Zs)



max
s+1uT

s(Zu )

in (5) is true. If s(n) is the first time where (5) is valid, we put 0(n) = s(n) on trajectory n. Finally we compute 0(Zb0 ) from the sample Zb(0n), n = 1, ..., N.

Dual upper bounds
We consider the construction of an additive dual upper bound for a regular, recursive DMU functional, which is translation invariant. Let us assume that we are given a proxy Yt = U (t, St) of the Snell envelope Yt = U (t, St). Note that the Snell envelope is indeed of this form due to assumptions i), ii), and iv). For instance, for the DMU functional in Example 3.6, a proxy may be constructed by approximating the Snell envelope with respect to a more simple functional, replacing the representing set Q of probability measures by a smaller subset or even a singleton. Let M Y be the Doob -martingale of Y and consider the upper bound

Y0up

=

0

( max
0tT

Zt + MTY - MtY

)

T -1

= 0

max
0tT

h(t, St) +

[U (s + 1, Ss+1) - s (U (s + 1, Ss+1))]

s=t

.

Similar as in [1] we are going to construct an approximation of this upper bound by a nested simulation. We simulate N (outer) trajectories S(n), n = 1, ..., N, from t = 0 to T, and for each outer trajectory n, and time s, s < T, a set of M (inner) two step trajectories (mSu(n))u=s,s+1, m = 1, ..., M. On a fixed

17

outer trajectory S(n) we then construct for each s an approximation of (sn) (U (s + 1, Ss+1)) by the inner sample U (s + 1, 1Ss(n+)1), ..., U (s + 1, M Ss(n+)1), and next determine

T -1

(n) := max
0tT

h(t, St(n)) +

U (s + 1, Ss(n+)1) - (sn) (U (s + 1, Ss+1))

s=t

.

We thus end up with the sample (1), ..., (N) of the random variable  := max
0tT

Zt + MTY - MtY

, from

which finally Y0up = 0() may be estimated.

Multiplicative and consumption upper bounds
From the simulation methods sketched above it will be clear in principle how to construct a multiplicative upper bound for a positively homogeneous DMU functional, and how to construct an upper (lower) bound due to the consumption representation in Theorem 7.1 for a translation invariant functional when a lower (upper) bound of the Snell envelope is given.

Concluding remark
In this article different representations for the optimal stopping problem with respect to general DMU functionals are presented. It is shown that these representations allow for a numerical treatment of the generalized stopping problem. A detailed analysis of the numerical algorithms sketched in Section8, which will depend on particular properties of the functional under consideration, remains to be done in future work.

A Appendix

Proof of Theorem 4.1: The inequalities Yt  Yt and Yt  Yt are obvious for any t  {0, ..., T }. So inequality Yt  Yt is left to show. We shall use backward use induction.
Due to the definition of Y and Y , we have YT = YT = T (ZT ). Suppose that Yt  Yt holds for any
t  {1, ..., T }. We then have to show that Yt-1  Yt-1. For this we first show sequentially

(1) 1[^t-1=t-1]Yt-1 = 1[^t-1=t-1]t-1(Zt-1).

as required.
proof of (1): By regulation condition (C2) we may find sequentially

1[^t-1=t-1]Yt-1 = t-1(1[^t-1=t-1]Z^t-1 ) = t-1(1[^t-1=t-1]Zt-1) = 1[^t-1=t-1]t-1(Zt-1),
which proves (1).
proof of (2): 1 Z[^t-1>t-1] ^t-1 = 1[^t-1>t-1]Z^t due to time consistency of (^t)t{0,...,T }. Hence the regularity condition implies

1[^t-1>t-1]Yt-1 = t-1(1[^t-1>t-1]Z^t-1 ) = t-1(1[^t-1>t-1]Z^t ) = 1[^t-1>t-1]t-1(Z^t ) = 1[^t-1>t-1]t-1(Yt).

By the induction hypothesis we have Yt  Yt, so we may conclude by monotonicity of t-1,

1[^t-1 >t-1] Yt-1



1[^t-1>t-1]t-1(Yt)



1[^t-1 >t-1]

max
tsT

t-1(t(Zs ))

=

1[^t-1 >t-1]

max
tsT

t-1(Zs ).

Thus (2) is shown.
proof of (3): Using regularity condition (C2) we obtain

t-1(Zt-1 ) = 1[t-1=t-1]t-1(Zt-1 ) + 1[t-1>t-1]t-1(Zt-1 ) = t-1(1[t-1=t-1]Zt-1) + t-1(1[t-1>t-1]Zt-1 ).
1 Z[t-1>t-1] t-1 = 1[t-1>t-1]Zt due to time consistency of (t)t{0,...,T }. Hence the application of regularity again yields

t-1(Zt-1 ) = sdarticlet-1(1[t-1=t-1]Zt-1) + t-1(1[t-1>t-1]Zt ) = 1[t-1=t-1]t-1(Zt-1) + 1[t-1>t-1]t-1(Zt ),

obviously implying (3), and hence completing the proof.

Proof of Lemma 5.2:
We shall show the statement of Lemma 5.2 via backward induction. The case t = T is trivial since TT = {T }. So let us assume that for any t  {1, ..., T }, we have t(Z) = t(Z + MT - M) for every   Tt. Let us fix an arbitrary   Tt-1, and define ( ) := t1[=t-1] +  1[>t-1]  Tt. Then by assumption t(Z()) = t(Z() + MT - M()), which implies via regularity and recursiveness,

1[ >t-1]t-1(Z )

= = (C=2)

1[ >t-1]t(Z( )) = 1[ >t-1]t-1  t(Z( )) 1[ >t-1]t-1 t(Z( ) + MT - M( )) = 1[ >t-1]t-1(Z( ) + MT - M( ))
1[>t-1]t-1(Z + MT - M ).

19

Moreover, by regularity, conditional translation invariance, and the -martingale property of M we have,

1[=t-1]t-1(Z + MT - M )

(C2)
= (C=3) =

1[ =t-1]t-1(Zt-1 + MT - Mt-1)
1[=t-1] (Zt-1 - Mt-1 + t-1(MT )) 1[ =t-1]Zt-1 = 1[ =t-1]t-1(Zt-1).

which completes the proof.

Proof of Lemma 6.2:

We shall show the statement of the lemma by backward induction. The case t = T is trivial since

TT = {T }. Let us assume that for t  {1, ..., T } the equality t(Z ) = t

Z NT N

is valid for every

  Tt.

Consider an arbitrary   Tt-1, and define ( ) := 1=t-1t + 1>t  Tt. By the induction assumption

we have t

Z( )NT N( )

= t(Z()), so that regularity condition (C2) and recursiveness imply

1[ >t-1]t-1

Z NT N

(C=2)

1[ >t-1]t-1

t

= 1[ >t-1]t-1 t Z( ) = 1[ >t-1]t-1 Z( ) (C=2) 1[ >t-1]t-1 (Z ) .
Moreover, by regularity (C2), conditional positive homogeneity (C6), and the fact that N is a -martingale, it holds
