Confidence Bands in Quantile Regression
Wolfgang K. Ha¨rdle , Song Song 
Abstract Let (X1, Y1), . . ., (Xn, Yn) be i.i.d. rvs and let l(x) be the unknown p-quantile regression curve of Y conditional on X. A quantilesmoother ln(x) is a localised, nonlinear estimator of l(x). The strong uniform consistency rate is established under general conditions. In many applications it is necessary to know the stochastic fluctuation of the process {ln(x) - l(x)}. Using strong approximations of the empirical process and extreme value theory, we consider the asymptotic maximal deviation sup0 x 1 |ln(x) - l(x)|. The derived result helps in the construction of a uniform confidence band for the quantile curve l(x). This confidence band can be applied as a econometric model check. An economic application considers the relation between age and earnings in labour market by means of parametric model specification tests, which presents a new framework to describe trends in the entire wage distribution in a parsimonious way.

derlying structures can be gained by considering other aspects of the conditional distribution. The quantile curves are key aspects of inference in various economic problems and are of great interest in practice. These describe the conditional behaviour of a response variable (e.g. wage of workers) given the value of an explanatory variable (e.g. education level, experience, occupation of workers), and investigate changes in both tails of the distribution, other than just the mean.
When examining labour markets, economists are concerned with whether discrimination exists, for example for different genders, nationalities, union status and so on. To study this question, we need to separate out other effects first, e.g. age, education, etc. The crucial relation between age and earnings or salaries belongs to the most carefully studied subjects in labor economics. The fundamental work in mean regression can be found in Murphy and Welch (1990). Quantile regression estimates could provide more accurate measures. Koenker and Hallock (2001) present a basket of important economic applications, including quantile Engel curves and claim that "quantile regression is gradually developing into a comprehensive strategy for completing the regression prediction". Besides this, it is also well-known that a quantile regression model (e.g. the conditional median curve) is more robust to outliers, especially for fat-tailed distributions. For symmetric conditional distributions the quantile regression generates the nonparametric mean regression analysis since the p = 0.5 (median) quantile curve coincides with the mean regression.
As first introduced by Koenker and Bassett (1978), one may assume a parametric model for the p-quantile curve and estimate parameters by the interior point method discussed by Koenker and Park (1996) and Portnoy and Koenker (1997). Similarly, we can also adopt nonparametric methods to estimate conditional quantiles. The first one, a more direct approach using a check function such as a robustified local linear smoother, is provided by Fan et al. (1994) and further extended by Yu and Jones (1997, 1998). An alternative procedure is first to estimate the conditional distribution function using the double-kernel local linear technique of Fan et al. (1996) and then to invert the conditional distribution estimator to produce an estimator of a conditional quantile by Yu and Jones (1997, 1998). Beside these, Hall et al. (1999) proposed a weighted version of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, which was further studied by Cai (2002). Recently Jeong and Ha¨rdle (2008) have developed the conditional quantile causality test. More generally, for an M -regression function which involves quantile regression as a special case, the uniform Bahadur representation and application to the additive model is studied by Kong et al. (2008). An interesting question for the parametric fitting, especially from labour economicsts, would be how well these models
2

fit the data, when compared with the nonparametric estimation method.
Let (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . ., (Xn, Yn) be a sequence of independent identically distributed bivariate random variables with joint pdf f (x, y), joint cdf F (x, y), conditional pdf f (y|x), f (x|y), conditional cdf F (y|x), F (x|y) for Y
given X and X given Y respectively, and marginal pdf fX(x) for X, fY (y) for Y where x  J, and J is a possibly infinite interval in Rd and y  R. In general, X may be a multivariate covariate, although here we restrict atten-
tion to the univariate case and J = [0, 1] for convenience. Let l(x) denote the p-quantile curve, i.e. l(x) = FY-|1x(p).
Under a "check function", the quantile regression curve l(x) can be viewed as the minimiser of L() d=ef E{p(y - )|X = x} (w.r.t. ) with p(u) = pu1{u  (0, )} - (1 - p)u1{u  (-, 0)} which was originally motivated
by an exercise in Ferguson (1967)[p.51] in the literature.
A kernel-based p-quantile curve estimator ln(x) can naturally be constructed by minimising:

n
Ln() = n-1 p(Yi - )Kh(x - Xi)
i=1

(1)

with respect to   I where I is a possibly infinite, or possibly degenerate, interval in R, and Kh(u) = h-1K(u/h) is a kernel with bandwidth h. The numerical solution of (1) may be found iteratively as in Lejeune and Sarda (1988) and Yu et al. (2003).
In light of the concepts of M -estimation as in Huber (1981), if we define (u) as:

p(u) = p1{u  (0, )} - (1 - p)1{u  (-, 0)} = p - 1{u  (-, 0)},

ln(x) and l(x) can be treated as a zero (w.r.t. ) of the function:

n
Hn(, x) d=ef n-1 Kh(x - Xi)(Yi - )
i=1
H(, x) d=ef f (x, y)(y - )dy
R

(2) (3)

correspondingly. To show the uniform consistency of the quantile smoother, we shall reduce
the problem of strong convergence of ln(x) - l(x), uniformly in x, to an application of the strong convergence of Hn(, x) to H(, x), uniformly in x

and , as given by Theorem 2.2 in H¨ardle et al. (1988). It is shown that under general conditions almost surely (a.s.)

sup |ln(x) - l(x)| B max{(nh/(log n))-1/2, h~}, as n  .
xJ
where B and ~ are parameters defined more precisely in Section 2. Please note that without assuming K has compact support (as we do
here) under similar assumptions Franke and Mwita (2003) get:

ln(x) = F^Y-|1x(p)

Thus {nh/(log n)}-1/2 {nh/(sn log n)}-1/2.

By employing similar methods as those developed in H¨ardle (1989) it is

shown in this paper that

(4)

from the asymptotic Gumbel distribution where r(x), , (K), dn are suitable scaling parameters. The asymptotic result (4) therefore allows the construction of (asymptotic) uniform confidence bands for l(x) based on specifications of the stochastic fluctuation of ln(x). The strong approximation with Brownian bridge techniques that we use in this paper is available only for the approximation of the 2-dimensional empirical process. The extension to the multivariate covariable can be done by partial linear modelling which deserves furthur research.
The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the stochastic fluctuation of the process {ln(x) - l(x)} and the uniform confidence band are presented through the equivalence of several stochastic processes, with a strong uniform consistency rate of {ln(x) - l(x)} also shown. In Section 3, in a small Monte Carlo study we investigate the behaviour of ln(x) when the data is generated by fat-tailed conditional distributions of (Y |X = x). In Section 4, an application considers a wage-earning relation in the labour market. All proofs are sketched in Section 5.

2 Results
The following assumptions will be convenient. To make x and X clearly distinguishable, we replace x by t sometimes, but they are essentially the same. (A1) The kernel K(·) is positive, symmetric, has compact support [-A, A] and is Lipschitz continuously differentiable with bounded derivatives; (A2) (nh)-1/2(log n)3/2  0, (n log n)1/2h5/2  0, (nh3)-1(log n)2 M , M a constant; (A3) h-3(log n) |y|>an fY (y)dy = O(1), fY (y) the marginal density of Y , {an}n=1 a sequence of constants tending to infinity as n  ; (A4) inftJ |q(t)| q0 > 0, where q(t) =  E{(Y - )|t}/|=l(t) · fX(t) = f {l(t)|t}fX(t); (A5) the quantile function l(t) is Lipschitz twice continuously differentiable, for all t  J. (A6) 0 < m1 fX(t) M1 < , t  J ; the conditional densities f (·|y), y  R, are uniform local Lipschitz continuous of order ~ (ulL-~) on J, uniformly in y  R, with 0 < ~ 1.
Define also
2(t) = E[2{Y - l(t)}|t] = p(1 - p)
n
Hn(t) = (nh)-1 K{(t - Xi)/h}{Yi - l(t)}
i=1 n
Dn(t) = (nh)-1 K{(t - Xi)/h}{Yi - }/|=l(t)
i=1
and assume that 2(t) and fX(t) are differentiable. Assumption (A1) on the compact support of the kernel could possibly be
relaxed by introducing a cutoff technique as in Cso¨rg¨o and Hall (1982) for density estimators. Assumption (A2) has purely technical reasons: to keep the bias at a lower rate than the variance and to ensure the vanishing of some non-linear remainder terms. Assumption (A3) appears in a somewhat modified form also in Johnston (1982). Assumptions (A5, A6) are common assumptions in robust estimation as in Huber (1981), H¨ardle et al. (1988) that are satisfied by exponential, and generalised hyperbolic distributions.
For the uniform strong consistency rate of ln(x)-l(x), we apply the result of Ha¨rdle et al. (1988) by taking (y) = (y - ), y  R, for   I = R, q1 = q2 = -1, 1(y) = max{0, -(y - )}, 2(y) = min{0, -(y - )} and  =  to satisfy the representations for the parameters there. Thus from Theorem 2.2 and Remark 2.3(v) there we immediately have the following lemma.
5

LEMMA 2.1 Let Hn(, x) and H(, x) be given by (2) and (3). Under assumption (A6) and (nh/ log n)-1/2   through (A2), for some constant
A not depending on n, we have a.s. as n  

sup sup |Hn(, x) - H(, x)|  A max{(nh/ log n)-1/2, h~}

For our result on ln(·), we shall also require

where 1 and q~ are some positive constants, see also Ha¨rdle and Luckhaus (1984). This assumption is satisfied if there exists a constant q~ such that f (l(x)|x) > q~/p, x  J.

with B = A/m1q~ not depending on n and m1 a lower bound of fX(t). If additionally ~ {log( log n) - log( nh)}/log h, it can be further simplified
to sup |ln(x) - l(x)|  B{(nh/ log n)-1/2}.

Then (4) holds with

r(x) = (nh)1/2f {l(x)|x}{fX(x)/p(1 - p)}1/2.

This theorem can be used to construct uniform confidence intervals for the regression function as stated in the following corollary.

6

COROLLARY 2.1 Under the assumptions of the theorem above, an approximate (1 - ) × 100% confidence band over [0, 1] is

ln(t) ± (nh)-1/2{p(1 - p)(K)/f^X (t)}1/2f^-1{l(t)|t}{dn + c()(2 log n)-1/2},
where c() = log 2 - log | log(1 - )| and f^X(t), f^{l(t)|t} are consistent estimates for fX(t), f {l(t)|t}.

In the literature, according to Fan et al. (1994, 1996), Yu and Jones (1997, 1998), Hall et al. (1999), Cai (2002) and others, asymptotic normality at interior points for various nonparametric smoothers, e.g. local constant, local linear, reweighted NW methods, etc. has been shown:
 nh{ln(t) - l(t)}  N 0,  2(t)
with  2(t) = (K)p(1 - p)/[fX(t)f 2{l(t)|t}]. Please note that the bias term vanishes here as we adjust h. With  (t) introduced, we can further write Corollary 2.1 as:

ln(t) ± (nh)-1/2{dn + c()(2 log n)-1/2}^(t).

Through minimising the approximation of AMSE (asymptotic mean square error), the optimal bandwidth hp can be computed. In practice, the rule-ofthumb for hp is given by Yu and Jones (1998):
1. Use ready-made and sophisticated methods to select optimal bandwidth hmean from conditional mean regression, e.g. Ruppert et al. (1995)
2. hp = [p(1 - p)/2{-1(p)}]1/5 · hmean with ,  as the pdf and cdf of a standard normal distribution

Obviously the further p lies from 0.5, the more smoothing is necessary. The proof is essentially based on a linearisation argument after a Taylor
series expansion. The leading linear term will then be approximated in a similar way as in Johnston (1982), Bickel and Rosenblatt (1973). The main idea behind the proof is a strong approximation of the empirical process of {(Xi, Yi)ni=1} by a sequence of Brownian bridges as proved by Tusnady (1977).
As ln(t) is the zero (w.r.t. ) of Hn(, t), it follows by applying 2nd-order Taylor expansions to Hn(, t) around l(t) that

ln(t) - l(t) = {Hn(t) - E Hn(t)}/q(t) + Rn(t)

(8)

7

where {Hn(t) - E Hn(t)}/q(t) is the leading linear term and

Rn(t) = Hn(t){q(t) - Dn(t)}/{Dn(t) · q(t)} + E Hn(t)/q(t)

is the remainder term. In Section 5 it is shown (Lemma 5.1) that Rn = suptJ |Rn(t)| = Op{(nh log n)-1/2}.
Furthermore, the rescaled linear part

Yn(t) = (nh)1/2{2(t)fX (t)}-1/2{Hn(t) - E Hn(t)}

is approximated by a sequence of Gaussian processes, leading finally to the Gaussian process

Y5,n(t) = h-1/2 K{(t - x)/h}dW (x).

(11)

Drawing upon the result of Bickel and Rosenblatt (1973), we finally obtain asymptotically the Gumbel distribution.
We also need the Rosenblatt (1952) transformation,
T (x, y) = {FX|y(x|y), FY (y)},
which transforms (Xi, Yi) into T (Xi, Yi) = (Xi, Yi ) mutually independent uniform rv's. In the event that x is a d-dimension covariate, the transformation becomes:
T (x1, x2, . . . , xd, y) = {FX1|y(x1|y), FX2|y(x2|x1, y), . . . , FXk|xd-1,...,x1,y(xk|xd-1, . . . , x1, y), FY (y)}. (12)
With the aid of this transformation, Theorem 1 of Tusnady (1977) may be applied to obtain the following lemma.
LEMMA 2.2 On a suitable probability space a sequence of Brownian bridges Bn exists that
sup |Zn(x, y) - Bn{T (x, y)}| = O{n-1/2(log n)2} a.s.,
xJ,yR
where Zn(x, y) = n1/2{Fn(x, y) - F (x, y)} denotes the empirical process of {(Xi, Yi)}in=1.

8

For d > 2, it is still an open problem which deserves further research. Before we define the different approximating processes, let us first rewrite
(11) as a stochastic integral w.r.t. the empirical process Zn(x, y),

Yn(t) = {hg (t)}-1/2 K{(t - x)/h}{y - l(t)}dZn(x, y),

g (t) = 2(t)fX(t). The approximating processes are now:

Y0,n(t) = {hg(t)}-1/2

K{(t - x)/h}{y - l(t)}dZn(x, y)

n

where n = {|y| an}, g(t) = E[2{y - l(t)} · 1(|y|

Y1,n(t) = {hg(t)}-1/2

K{(t - x)/h}{y - l(t)}dBn{T (x, y)}

n

{Bn} being the sequence of Brownian bridges from Lemma 2.2.

(14)

Y2,n(t) = {hg(t)}-1/2

K{(t - x)/h}{y - l(t)}dWn{T (x, y)}

n

{Wn} being the sequence of Wiener processes satisfying

(15)

Bn(x , y ) = Wn(x , y ) - x y Wn(1, 1)

Y3,n(t) = {hg(t)}-1/2 K{(t - x)/h}{y - l(x)}dWn{T (x, y)}
n

(16) (17)

Y5,n(t) = h-1/2 K{(t - x)/h}dW (x)

(18)

{W (·)} being the Wiener process.
Lemmas 5.2 to 5.7 ensure that all these processes have the same limit distributions. The result then follows from

9

LEMMA 2.3 (Theorem 3.1 in Bickel and Rosenblatt (1973)) Let dn, (K),  as in Theorem 2.2. Let
Y5,n(t) = h-1/2 K{(t - x)/h}dW (x).

Then, as n  , the supremum of Y5,n(t) has a Gumbel distribution.
P (2 log n)1/2 sup |Y5,n(t)|/{(K)}1/2 - dn < z  exp{-2 exp(-z)}.

3 A Monte Carlo Study

We generate bivariate data {(Xi, Yi)}in=1, n = 500 with joint pdf: 
f (x, y) = g(y - x + 2.5)1(x  [-2.5, 2.5]) 91
g(u) = (u) + (u/9). 10 90
The p-quantile curve l(x) can be obtained from a zero (w.r.t. ) of:

(19)

9() + (/9) = 10p,

with  as the cdf of a standard normal distribution. Solving it numerically gives the 0.5-quantile curve l(x) = x + 2.5, and the 0.9-quantile curve l(x) = 1.5296 + x + 2.5. We use the quartic kernel:

K(u) = 15 (1 - u2)2, |u| 1, 16

= 0,

|u| > 1.

In Fig. 1 the raw data, together with the 0.5-quantile curve, are displayed.

mn(x) and the 0.5-quantile smoother ln(x). The bandwidth is set to 1.25 which is equivalent to 0.25 after rescaling x to [0, 1] and fulfills the require-

ments of Theorem 2.2.

In Fig. 1 l(x), mn(x) and ln(x) are shown as a dotted line, dashed-dot line, and solid line respectively. At first sight mn (x) has clearly more variation and has the expected sensitivity to the fat-tails of f (x, y). A closer look reveals

that mn(x) for x  0 apparently even leaves the 0.5-quantile curve. It may be surprising that this happens at x  0 where no outlier is placed, but a closer

look at Fig. 1 shows that the large negative data values at both x  -0.1 and

x  0.25 cause the problem. This data value is inside the window (h = 1.10) and therefore distorts mn(x) for x  0. The quantile-smoother ln(x) (solid line) is unaffected and stays fairly close to the 0.5-quantile curve. Similar results can be obtained in Fig. 2 corresponding to the 0.9 quantile (h = 1.25) with the 95% confidence band.
4 Application
Recently there has been great interest in finding out how the financial returns of a job depend on the age of the employee. We use the Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 2005 for the following group: male aged 25 - 59, full-time employed, and college graduate containing 16, 731 observations, for the age-earning estimation. As is usual for wage data, a log transformation to hourly real wages (unit: US dollar) is carried out first. In the CPS all ages (25  59) are reported as integers. We rescaled them into [0, 1] by dividing 40 by bandwidth 0.059 for nonparametric quantile-smoothers. This is equivalent to set bandwidth 2 for the original age data.
In Fig. 3 the original observations are displayed as small stars. The local 0.5 and 0.9 quantiles at the integer points of age are shown as dashed lines,

whereas the corresponding nonparametric quantile-smoothers are displayed as solid lines with corresponding 95% uniform confidence bands shown as dashed-dot lines. A closer look reveals a quadratic relation between age and logged hourly real wages. If we use several popular parametric methods to estimate the 0.5 and 0.9 conditional quantiles, e.g. quadratic, quartic and set of dummies (a dummy variable for each 5-year age group) models as in Fig. 4. With the help of the 95% uniform confidence bands, we can do the parametric model specification test. At the 5% significance level, we could not reject any model. However, when the confidence level further decreases and the uniform confidence bands get narrower, "set of dummies" parametric model will be the first one to be rejected. At the 10% significance level, the set of dummies (for age groups) model is rejected while the other two are not. As the quadratic model performs quite similar by the quartic one, for simplicity, it is suggested in practice to measure the log(wage)-earing relation which coincides with Murphy and Welch (1990) in mean regression.

5 Appendix

Proof of Theorem 2.1. By the definition of ln(x) as a zero of (2), we have, for  > 0,

if ln(x) > l(x) + , and then Hn{l(x) + , x} > 0. Now

(20)

Hn{l(x) + , x} H{l(x) + , x} + sup |Hn(, x) - H(, x)|.
I

(21)

Also, by the identity H{l(x), x} = 0, the function H{l(x) + , x} is not positive and has a magnitude m1q~ by assumption (A6) and (6), for 0 <  < 1. That is, for 0 <  < 1,

H{l(x) + , x} -m1q~. Combining (20), (21) and (22), we have, for 0 <  < 1:

(22)

if ln(x) > l(x) + , and then sup sup |Hn(, x) - H(, x)| > m1q~.
I xJ

With a similar inequality proved for the case ln(x) < l(x) + , we obtain, for 0 <  < 1:

if sup |ln(x) - l(x)| > , and then sup sup |Hn(, x) - H(, x)| > m1q~. (23)
xJ I xJ

It readily follows that (23), and (5) imply (7). Below we first show that Rn  = suptJ |Rn(t)| vanishes asymptotically faster than the rate (nh log n)-1/2; for simplicity we will just use · to indicate the sup-norm.

LEMMA 5.1 For the remainder term Rn(t) defined in (9) we have Rn = Op{(nh log n)-1/2}.

Proof. First we have by the positivity of the kernel K,

-1
Rn inf {|Dn(t)| · q(t)} { Hn · q - Dn + Dn · E Hn }
0t1
-1
+C1 · ln - l 2 · inf |Dn(t)| · fn ,
0t1

where fn(x) = (nh)-1

n i=1

K

{(x

-

Xi)/h}.

14

The desired result (5.1) will then follow if we prove
Hn = Op{(nh)-1/2(log n)1/2} q - Dn = Op{(nh)-1/4(log n)-1/2}
E Hn = O(h2) ln - l 2 = Op{(nh)-1/2(log n)-1/2}
Since (27) follows from the well-known bias calculation

(25) (26) (27) (28)

E Hn(t) = h-1 K{(t - u)/h} E[{y - l(t)}|X = u]fX(u)du = O(h2),

where O(h2) is independent of t in Parzen (1962), we have from assumption (A2) that E Hn = Op{(nh)-1/2(log n)-1/2}.
According to Lemma A.3 in Franke and Mwita (2003),
sup |Hn(t) - E Hn(t)| = O{(nh)-1/2(log n)1/2}.
tJ
and the following inequality
Hn Hn - E Hn + E Hn . = O{(nh)-1/2(log n)1/2} + Op{(nh)-1/2(log n)-1/2} = O{(nh)-1/2(log n)1/2}
Statement (25) thus is obtained. Statement (26) follows in the same way as (25) using assumption (A2)
and the Lipschitz continuity properties of K,  , l. According to the uniform consistency of ln(t)-l(t) shown before, we have
ln - l = Op{(nh)-1/2(log n)1/2}
which implies (28). Now the assertion of the lemma follows, since by tightness of Dn(t),
inf0 t 1 |Dn(t)| q0 a.s. and thus
Rn = Op{(nh log n)-1/2}(1 + fn ). Finally, by Theorem 3.1 of Bickel and Rosenblatt (1973), fn = Op(1); thus the desired result Rn = Op{(nh log n)-1/2} follows.
We now begin with the subsequent approximations of the processes Y0,n to Y5,n.

LEMMA 5.2
Y0,n - Y1,n = O{(nh)-1/2(log n)2} a.s.
Proof. Let t be fixed and put L(y) = {y - l(t)} still depending on t. Using integration by parts, we obtain

L(y)K{(t - x)/h}dZn(x, y)

If we apply the same operation to Y1,n with Bn{T (x, y)} instead of Zn(x, y) and use Lemma 2.2, we finally obtain
sup h1/2g(t)1/2|Y0,n(t) - Y1,n(t)| = O{n-1/2(log n)2} a.s..
0t1

LEMMA 5.3 Y1,n - Y2,n = Op(h1/2).

Proof. Note that the Jacobian of T (x, y) is f (x, y). Hence

Y1,n(t) - Y2,n(t) = {g(t)h}-1/2

{y - l(t)}K{(t - x)/h}f (x, y)dxdy · |Wn(1, 1)|.
n

16

It follows that

h-1/2 Y1,n - Y2,n

|Wn(1, 1)| · g-1/2

· sup h-1

|{y - l(t)}K{(t - x)/h}|f (x, y)dxdy.

0t1

n

Since g-1/2 is bounded by assumption, we have

h-1/2 Y1,n - Y2,n |Wn(1, 1)| · C4 · h-1 K{(t - x)/h}dx = Op(1).

LEMMA 5.4 Y2,n - Y3,n = Op(h1/2). Proof. The difference |Y2,n(t) - Y3,n(t)| may be written as
{g(t)h}-1/2 [{y - l(t)} - {y - l(x)}]K{(t - x)/h}dWn{T (x, y)} .
n
If we use the fact that l is uniformly continuous, this is smaller than h-1/2|g(t)|-1/2 · Op(h)
and the lemma thus follows.

LEMMA 5.5 Y4,n - Y5,n = Op(h1/2).

Proof.

|Y4,n(t) - Y5,n(t)| = h-1/2

g(x) 1/2 - 1 K{(t - x)/h}dW (x)

by the mean value theorem it follows that

h-1/2 S2,n = Op(1).

The first term S1,n is estimated as

Since S3,n(t) is estimated as S2,n(t), we finally obtain the desired result.

The next lemma shows that the truncation introduced through {an} does not affect the limiting distribution.

LEMMA 5.6 Yn - Y0,n = Op{(log n)-1/2}.
Proof. We shall only show that g (t)-1/2h-1/2 R-n {y - l(t)}K{(t - x)/h}dZn(x, y) fulfills the lemma. The replacement of g (t) by g(t) may be proved as in Lemma A.4 of Johnston (1982). The quantity above is less than h-1/2 g-1/2 · {|y|>an} {y - l(·)}K{(· - x)/h}dZ(x, y) . It remains to be shown that the last factor tends to zero at a rate Op{(log n)-1/2}. We show first that

Vn(t) = (log n)1/2h-1/2

{y - l(t)}K{(t - x)/h}dZn(x, y)

{|y|>an}

p 0 for all t

18

and then we show tightness of Vn(t), the result then follows:
n
Vn(t) = (log n)1/2(nh)-1/2 [{Yi - l(t)}1(|Yi| > an)K{(t - Xi)/h}
i=1
- E {Yi - l(t)}1(|Yi| > an)K{(t - Xi)/h}]
n
= Xn,t(t),
i=1
where {Xn,t(t)}ni=1 are i.i.d. for each n with E Xn,t(t) = 0 for all t  [0, 1]. We then have

E Xn2,t(t)

(log n)(nh)-1 E 2{Yi - l(t)}1(|Yi| > an)K2{(t - Xi)/h}
sup K2(u) · (log n)(nh)-1 E 2{Yi - l(t)}1(|Yi| > an);
-A u A

hence

Xn,t(t) = n · E Xn2,t(t)

-A u A

{|y|>an}

where M denotes an upper bound for 2. This term tends to zero by assumption (A3). Thus by Markov's inequality we conclude that

Vn(t) p 0 for all t  [0, 1].
To prove tightness of {Vn(t)} we refer again to the following moment condition as stated in Lemma 5.1:

E{|Vn(t) - Vn(t1)| · |Vn(t2) - Vn(t)|} C · (t2 - t1)2 C denoting a constant, t  [t1, t2].
We again estimate the left-hand side by Schwarz's inequality and estimate each factor separately,

n

E{Vn(t) - Vn(t1)}2 = (log n)(nh)-1 E

n(t, t1, Xi, Yi) · 1(|Yi| > an)

i=1

2
- E{n(t, t1, Xi, Yi) · 1(|Yi| > an)} ,

19

where n(t, t1, Xi, Yi) = {Yi - l(t)}K{(t - Xi)/h} - {Yi - l(t1)}K{(t1 - X1)/h}. Since , K are Lipschitz continuous except at one point and the expectation is taken afterwards, it follows that

[E{Vn(t) - Vn(t1)}2]1/2 C7 · (log n)1/2h-3/2|t - t1| ·

1/2
fy(y)dy .
{|y|>an}

If we apply the same estimation to Vn(t2) - Vn(t1) we finally have

E{|Vn(t) - Vn(t1)| · |Vn(t2) - Vn(t)|}

C72(log n)h-3|t - t1||t2 - t| ×

fy(y)dy

{|y|>an}

C · |t2 - t1|2 since t  [t1, t2] by (A3).

LEMMA 5.7 Let (K) = K2(u)du and let {dn} be as in the theorem. Then
(2 log n)1/2[ Y3,n /{(K)}1/2 - dn]
has the same asymptotic distribution as
(2 log n)1/2[ Y4,n /{(K)}1/2 - dn].

Proof. Y3,n(t) is a Gaussian process with E Y3,n(t) = 0
and covariance function

r3(t1, t2) = E Y3,n(t1)Y3,n(t2)

= {g(t1)g(t2)}-1/2h-1

= {g(t1)g(t2)}-1/2h-1 g(x)K{(t1 - x)/h}K{(t2 - x)/h}dx

= r4(t1, t2)
where r4(t1, t2) is the covariance function of the Gaussian process Y4,n(t), which proves the lemma.
