A Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model for Implied Volatility String Dynamics
Abstract A primary goal in modelling the implied volatility surface (IVS) for pricing and hedging aims at reducing complexity. For this purpose one fits the IVS each day and applies a principal component analysis using a functional norm. This approach, however, neglects the degenerated string structure of the implied volatility data and may result in a modelling bias. We propose a dynamic semiparametric factor model (DSFM), which approximates the IVS in a finite dimensional function space. The key feature is that we only fit in the local neighborhood of the design points. Our approach is a combination of methods from functional principal component analysis and backfitting techniques for additive models. The model is found to have an approximate 10% better performance than a sticky moneyness model. Finally, based on the DSFM, we devise a generalized vega-hedging strategy for exotic options that are priced in the local volatility framework. The generalized vega-hedging extends the usual approaches employed in the local volatility framework.

1 Introduction
Successful trading, hedging and risk managing of option portfolios crucially depends on the accuracy of the underlying pricing models. Consequently, new valuation approaches are continuously developed in departing from the foundations of option theory laid by Black and Scholes (1973), Merton (1973) and Harrison and Kreps (1979), and existing models are refined. However, despite these pervasive developments, the model of Black and Scholes (1973) remains a pivot in modern financial theory and an important benchmark for more sophisticated models, be it from a theoretical or practical point of view.
The popularity of the Black and Scholes (BS) model is likely due to its clear and easy-tocommunicate set of assumptions. Based on the geometric Brownian motion for the underlying asset price dynamics, and continuous trading in a complete and frictionless market, simple closed form solutions for plain vanilla calls and puts are derived: given the current underlying price at time, the option's strike price, its expiry date the prevailing riskless interest rate, and an estimate of the (expected) market volatility, option prices are straightforward to compute.
The crucial parameter in option valuation by BS is the market volatility. Since it is unknown, one studies implied volatility, which is derived by inverting the BS formula for a cross section of options with different strikes and maturities traded at the same point in time. As is visible in the left panel of Figure 1 for May 2, 2000 (i.e. 20000502, a notation we will use from now on), implied volatilities display a remarkable curvature across the strike dimension, and ­ albeit to a lesser degree ­ a term structure across time to maturity. For a given time to maturity the phenomenon is called smile or smirk. This dependence given by the mapping ^t : (,  )  ^t(,  ), where  denotes the strike dimension scaled in moneyness and  time to maturity, is called implied volatility surface (IVS). The index t denotes time-dependence. Apparently, it is in contrast with the BS framework in which volatility is assumed to be a constant across strikes, time to maturity and also time.
There is a considerable amount of literature which aims at reconciling this empirical antagonism with financial theory. Generally speaking, this can be achieved by including another degree of freedom into option pricing models: well-known examples are stochastic volatility

models (Hull and White, 1987; Stein and Stein, 1991; Heston, 1993), models with jump diffusions (Bates, 1996a,b), or models building on general L´evy processes, e.g. based on the inverse Gaussian (Barndorff-Nielsen, 1997), and generalized hyperbolic distribution (Eberlein and Prause, 2002). These approaches capture the smile and term structure phenomena and the complexity of its dynamics to some extent, as is documented for instance in Das and Sundaram (1999) and Bergomi (2004).
Nevertheless, the BS model and the IVS enjoy much popularity. Partly, this is due to the fact that the IVS is derived from a cross-section of option prices at a specific point in time. Therefore, unlike estimates based on historical data, the IVS is a widely accepted state variable that reflects current market sentiments, Bakshi et al. (2000). More importantly, however, the IVS plays a decisive role in trading: market makers at plain vanilla desks continuously monitor and update the IVS they trade on; and exotic derivatives trader calibrate their pricing engines with an estimate of the IVS. This is particularly obvious for the pricing systems relying on the local volatility models. Initially developed by Dupire (1994) and Der-

man and Kani (1994), they are in wide-spread use in form of the efficient implementations by Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliffe (1997) and Dempster and Richards (2000). Thus, refined statistical model building of the IVS determines vitally the accuracy of applications in trading and risk-management.
In modelling the IVS one faces two main challenges. First, the data have a degenerated design: due to institutional conventions, observations of the IVS occur only for a small number of maturities such as one, two, three, six, nine, twelve, 18, and 24 months to expiry on the date of issue. Consequently, implied volatilities appear in a row like pearls strung on a necklace, Figure 1, or, in short: as `strings'. This pattern is visible in the right panel of Figure 1, which plots the data design as seen from top. Options belonging to the same string have a common time to maturity. As time passes, the strings move through the maturity axis towards expiry while changing levels and shape in a random fashion. Second, also in the moneyness dimension, the observation grid does not cover the desired estimation grid at any point in time. Thus, even when the data sets are huge, for a large number of cases implied volatility observations are missing for certain sub-regions of the desired estimation
5

grid. This is particularly virulent when transaction based data are used. However, despite their appearance as strings, implied volatilities are thought as being the observed structure of a smooth surface. This is because in practice one needs to price and hedge OTC options whose expiry dates do not coincide with the expiry dates of the options that are traded at the futures exchange.
For the semi- or nonparametric approximations to the IVS that have been promoted by A¨itSahalia and Lo (1998), Rosenberg (2000), A¨it-Sahalia et al. (2001b), Cont and da Fonseca (2002), Fengler et al. (2003) and Fengler and Wang (2003), this design may pose difficulties. For illustration, consider in Figure 2 (left panel) the fit of a standard Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Bandwidths are h1 = 0.03 for the moneyness and h2 = 0.04 for the time to maturity dimension (measured in years). The fit appears very rough, and there are huge holes in the surface, since the bandwidths are too small to `bridge' the gaps between the maturity strings. In order to remedy this deficiency one would need to strongly increase the bandwidths which may induce a large bias. Moreover, since the design is time-varying, the bandwidths would also need to be adjusted anew for each trading day, which complicates daily applications. Parametric models, e.g. as in Shimko (1993), An´e and Geman (1999), and Brockhaus et al. (2000, Chap. 2) among others, are less affected by these data limitations, but appear to offer too little functional flexibility to capture the salient features of IVS patterns. Thus, parametric estimates may as well be biased.
In this paper we provide a new principal component approach for modelling the IVS: the complex dynamic structure of the IVS is captured by a low-dimensional dynamic semiparametric factor model (DSFM) with time-varying coefficients. The IVS is approximated by unknown basis functions moving in a finite dimensional function space. The dynamics can be understood by using vector autoregression (VAR) techniques on the time-varying coefficients. Contrary to earlier studies, we will use only finite dimensional fits to implied volatilities which are obtained in the local neighborhood of strikes and maturities, for which implied volatilities are recorded at the specific day. Surface estimation and dimension reduction is achieved in one single step. Our technology can be seen as a combination of functional principal component analysis, nonparametric curve estimation and backfitting for additive models.
Intuitively, the localization of our methodology can be interpreted as smoothing through
6

time, i.e. for fitting, the information contained in other observations dates in the sample is exploited, see Section 2 for the details. This is possible due to the expiry effect which is a unique feature present IVS data. As explained, this effect insures that observations gradually move through the entire observation space. To our knowledge there do not exist estimation techniques that explicitly take advantage of this effect.
To introduce our model, let us denote the implied volatility by Yi,j, where the index i is the number of the day (i = 1, . . . , I), and j = 1, . . . , Ji is an intra-day numbering of the option traded on day i. The observations Yi,j are regressed on two-dimensional covariables Xi,j that contain moneyness i,j and maturity i,j. Moneyness is defined as i,j d=ef Ki,j/Ft,i,j, i.e. strike Ki,j divided by the underlying futures price Ft,i,j at time ti,j. We also considered the one-dimensional case in which Xi,j = i,j. However, since modelling the entire surface is more interesting, we will present results for this case only. The DSFM is given by:

L
m0(Xi,j) + i,lml(Xi,j) ,
l=1

(1)

where ml are smooth basis functions (l = 0, . . . , L). The IVS is approximated by a weighted

sum of smooth functions ml with weights i,l depending on time i. The factor loading i d=ef (i,1, . . . i,L) forms an unobserved multivariate time series. By fitting model (1),

to the implied volatility strings we obtain approximations i. We argue that the VAR

estimation based on i is asymptotically equivalent to estimation based on the unobserved

i. A justification for this is given in Borak et al. (2005) where the relations to Kalman

filtering are discussed.

Lower dimensional approximations of the IVS based on principal components analysis (PCA) have been used in Zhu and Avellaneda (1997) and Fengler et al. (2002) in an application to the term structure of implied volatilities, and in Skiadopoulos et al. (1999) and Alexander (2001) in studies across strikes. Fengler et al. (2003) use a common principal components approach to study several maturity groups across the IVS simultaneously, while Cont and da Fonseca (2002) propose a functional PCA perspective for the IVS. All these approaches treat the IVS as a stationary process, and do not take particular care for the degenerated string structure apparent in Figure 1.

7

Our modelling approach is also different in the following respect: for instance, in Cont and da Fonseca (2002) the IVS is fitted on a grid for each day. Afterwards a PCA using a functional norm is applied to the surfaces. This treatment follows the usual functional PCA approach as described in Ramsay and Silverman (1997). In our approach the IVS is fitted each day at the observed design points Xi,j. This leads to a minimization with respect to functional norms that depend on time i. We loose a nice feature of the usual functional PCA though: when fitting the data for L and L = L + 1, the linear space spanned by m0, . . . , mL may not be contained in the one spanned by m0, . . . , mL . On the other hand we only make use of values of the implied volatilities at regions where they are observed. This avoids bias effects caused by global daily fits used in standard functional PCAs.
The model can be employed in several respects: given the estimated functions ml and the time series , scenario simulations of potential IVS scenarios are straightforward. They can help to give a more accurate assessment of market risk than previous approaches. Worst case scenarios can be identified, which provide additional supervision tools to risk managers. For trading, the model may be used as a tool of short range IVS prediction or as an input factor in the local volatility models such as the one by Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliffe (1997). As we will demonstrate, the model also offers a unified tool to traders for vega hedging of complex option positions in a local volatility setting.
The paper is organized as follows: in the following section, implied volatilities are described and the DSFM is introduced. In Section 3 the model is applied to DAX option implied volatilities for the sample period 1998 to May 2001. Section 4 discusses the hedging of complex option positions in the local volatility setting, Section 5 concludes.
2 Time-dependent implied volatility modelling
2.1 The semiparametric factor model
Implied volatilities are derived from the BS option pricing formula for European calls and puts, Black and Scholes (1973). European style calls and puts are contingent claims on an asset St (paying no dividends for simplicity, here), which yield the pay-off max(St - K, 0)
8

and max(K - St, 0), respectively, for a strike K at a given expiry day T . The asset price process St in the BS model is assumed to be a geometric Brownian motion. The BS option pricing formula for calls is given by:

CtBS(St, K, , r, ) = St(d1) - e-r K(d2) ,

(2)

where d1 d=ef

and

  .

(·) denotes the cumulative distribution

function of the standard normal distribution,  d=ef T - t time to maturity of the option,

r the riskless interest rate over the option's life time, and  the diffusion coefficient of the

Brownian motion. Put prices Pt are obtained via the put-call-parity Ct - Pt = St - e-rK.

The only unknown parameter in (2) is the volatility parameter . Given observed market prices C~t, implied volatility ^ is defined by:

CtBS(St, K, , r, ^) - C~t = 0 .

(3)

Due to monotonicity of the BS price in , there exists a unique solution ^ > 0. Define the moneyness metric t d=ef K/Ft, where Ft denotes the futures price time t.

In the dynamic factor model, we regress Yi,j d=ef log{^i,j(,  )} on Xi,j = (i,j, i,j) via nonparametric methods. We work with log-implied volatility data, since the data appear less skewed and potential outliers are scaled down after taking logs. This is common practice in the IVS literature, see e.g. Zhu and Avellaneda (1997) and Cont and da Fonseca (2002). In order to estimate the nonparametric components ml and the state variables i,l in (1), we borrow ideas from fitting additive models as in Stone (1986), Hastie and Tibshirani (1990) and Horowitz et al. (2002). Our research is related to functional coefficient models such as Cai et al. (2000). Other semi- and nonparametric factor models include Connor and Linton (2000), Gouri´eroux and Jasiak (2001), Fan et al. (2003), and Linton et al. (2003). Nonparametric techniques are now broadly used in option pricing, e.g. Broadie et al. (2000a), Broadie et al. (2000b), A¨it-Sahalia et al. (2001a), and A¨it-Sahalia and Duarte (2003).

The estimates ml, (l = 0, . . . , L) and i,l (i = 1, . . . , I; l = 1, . . . , L) are defined as minimizers of the following least squares criterion (i,0 d=ef 1):

I Ji i=1 j=1

L2
Yi,j - i,lml(u) Kh(u - Xi,j) du .
l=0

(4)

Here, Kh denotes a two-dimensional product kernel, Kh(u) = kh1(u1) × kh2(u2), h = (h1, h2), based on a one-dimensional kernel kh(v) d=ef h-1k(h-1v).
In (4) the minimization runs over all functions ml : R2  R and all values i,l  R. For illustration let us consider the case L = 0 : implied volatilities Yi,j are approximated by a surface m0 that does not depend on time i. In this degenerated case, m0(u) = i,j Kh(u - Xi,j)Yi,j/ i,j Kh(u - Xi,j), which is the Nadaraya-Watson estimate based on the pooled sample of all days.

Using (4), the implied volatility surfaces are approximated by surfaces moving in an L-

dimensional affine function space {m0 +

L l=1

lml

:

1, . . . , L  R}. The estimates ml

are

not uniquely defined: they can be replaced by functions that span the same affine space.

In order to respond to this problem, we select ml such that they are orthogonal. This will facilitate the interpretation of the functions, as shall be seen in Section 3 and 4.

Replacing in (4) ml by ml + g with arbitrary functions g and taking derivatives with respect to  yields, for 0  l  L:

I Ji i=1 j=1

L
Yi,j - i,lml(u)
l=0

i,l Kh(u - Xi,j) = 0 .

(5)

Furthermore, by replacing i,l by i,l +  in (4) and again taking derivatives with respect to , we get for 1  l  L and 1  i  I:

Ji L
Yi,j - i,lml(u) ml (u)Kh(u - Xi,j) du = 0 .
j=1 l=0
Introducing the following notation, for 1  i  I

(6)

1 Ji pi(u) = Ji j=1 Kh(u - Xi,j) ,
1 Ji qi(u) = Ji j=1 Kh(u - Xi,j)Yi,j ,

(7) (8)

we obtain from (5)-(6), for 1  l  L, 1  i  I:

I IL

Jii,l qi(u) =

Ji i,l i,lpi(u)ml(u) ,

i=1 i=1 l=0

L

qi(u)ml (u) du =

i,l pi(u)ml (u)ml(u) du .

l=0

(9) (10)

We calculate the estimates by iterative use of (9) and (10). We start by initial values i(,0l) for

i,l. A possible choice of the initial  could correspond to fits of surfaces that are piecewise
constant on time intervals I1, . . . , IL. This means, for l = 1, .., L, put i(,0l) = 1 (for i  Il),
L
and i(,0l) = 0 (for i / Il). Here I1, ..., IL are pairwise disjoint subsets of {1, ..., I} and Il
l=1
is a strict subset of {1, ..., I}. For r  0, we put i(,r0) = 1. Define the matrix B(r)(u) by its

elements:

I

B(r)(u) l,l d=ef

Jii(,rl-1)i(,rl-1)pi(u) ,

i=1

0  l, l  L ,

(11)

and introduce a vector Q(r)(u) with elements

I

Q(r)(u)l d=ef

Jii(,rl-1)qi(u) ,

i=1

0lL.

(12)

In the r-th iteration the estimate m = (m0, . . . , mL) is given by:

m(r)(u) = B(r)(u)-1Q(r)(u) .

(13)

This update step is motivated by (9). The values of  are updated in the r-th cycle as follows: define the matrix M (r)(i)

M (r)(i) l,l d=ef pi(u)m(lr)(u)ml(r)(u) du ,

1  l, l  L ,

(14)

and define a vector S(r)(i)

S(r)(i)l d=ef qi(u)ml(u) du - pi(u)m(0r)(u)m(lr)(u) du ,

1lL.

(15)

Motivated by (10), put

i(,r1), ..., i(,rL) = M (r)(i)-1S(r)(i) .

(16)

11

The algorithm is run until only minor changes occur. In the implementation, we choose a grid of points and calculate ml at these points. In the calculation of M (r)(i) and S(r)(i), we replace the integral by a Riemann sum approximation using the values of the integrated functions at the grid points.

As discussed above, ml and i,l are not uniquely defined. Therefore, we orthogonolize

m0, . . . , mL in L2(p^), where p^(u) = I-1

where m = (m1, . . . , mL) and the (L × L) matrix  = m(u)m(u) p^(u) du, or for clarity,  = (l,l ), with l,l = ml(u) ml (u)p^(u)du. Finally, we have  = (l), with l =
m0(u)ml(u)p^(u)du.

Note that by applying (17), m0 is replaced by a function that minimizes m20(u)p^(u)du. This is evident because m0 is orthogonal to the linear space spanned by m1, . . . mL. By the second equation of (17), m1, . . . , mL are replaced by orthonormal functions in L2(p^).

In a second step, we proceed as in PCA and define a matrix B with Bl,l =

and

calculate the eigenvalues of B, 1 > . . . > L, and the corresponding eigenvectors z1, . . . zL.

i.e.

m1 is chosen such that as much as possible is explained by i,1 m1. Next m2 is chosen to

achieve maximum explanation by i,1 m1 + i,2 m2, and so forth.

The functions ml are not eigenfunctions of an operator as in usual functional PCA. This is because we use a different norm, namely f 2(u)p^i(u)du, for each day. Through the norming procedure the functions are chosen as eigenfunctions in an L-dimensional approximating linear space. The L-dimensional approximating spaces are not necessarily nested for increasing L. For this reason the estimates cannot be calculated by an iterative procedure that starts by fitting a model with one component, and that uses the old L - 1 components in the iteration step from L - 1 to L to fit the next component. The calculation of m0, . . . , mL has to be fully redone for different choices of L.

3 The dynamic factors of the DAX index IVS
3.1 Data description and preparation
Our data set contains tick statistics on DAX futures contracts and DAX index options traded at the futures exchange EUREX in Frankfurt/Main in the period from January 1998 to May 2001. Both futures price and option price data are contract based data, i.e. each single contract is registered together with its price, contract size, and time of settlement up to a hundredth second. Interest rate data in daily frequency, i.e. one-, three-, six-, and twelve-months FIBOR rates for the years 1998­1999 and EURIBOR rates for the period 2000­2001, were obtained from Thomson Financial Datastream. Interest rate data were linearly interpolated to approximate the riskless interest rate for the option specific time to maturity.
In a first step, we recover the DAX index values. To this end, we group to each option price observation the futures price Ft of the nearest available futures contract, which was traded within a one minute interval around the observed option. The futures price observation was taken from the most heavily traded futures contract on the particular day, usually the three-

months contract. The no-arbitrage price of the underlying index in a frictionless market without dividends is given by St = Fte-rTF ,t(TF -t), where St and Ft denote the index and the futures price respectively, TF the futures contract's maturity date, and rT,t the interest rate with maturity T - t.
The DAX index is a capital weighted performance index, i.e. dividends less corporate tax are reinvested into the index, Deutsche Bo¨rse (2002). Therefore, dividend payments should have no impact on index options. However, when only the interest rate discounted futures price is used to recover implied volatilities by inverting the BS formula, implied volatilities of calls and puts can differ significantly. To accommodate for this fact we apply a correction algorithm that is described in Appendix B. The entire data set is stored in the financial database MD*base, www.mdtech.de, maintained at the Center for Applied Statistics and Economics (CASE), Berlin.

Since the data are transaction based and may contain misprints or outliers, a filter is applied before estimating the model: observations with implied volatility less than 4% and bigger than 80% are dropped. Furthermore, we disregard all observations having a maturity less than ten days. After this filtering, the entire number of observations is more than 4.48 million contracts, i.e. is around 5 200 observations per day.
Table 1 gives a short summary of our IVS data. Most heavy trading occurs in short term contracts, as is seen from the difference between median and mean of the term structure distribution of observations as well as from its skewness. Median time to maturity is 30 days (0.083 years). Across moneyness the distribution is slightly negatively skewed. Mean implied volatility over the sample period is 27.9%.
3.2 Empirical evidence
We model log-implied volatility Yi,j on Xi,j = (i,j, i,j) . The grid covers in moneyness   [0.80, 1.20] and in time to maturity   [0.05, 0.5] measured in years. We employ L = 3 basis functions, which capture around 96.0% of the variations in the IVS. To our understanding, this is of sufficiently high accuracy. The bandwidths are h1 = 0.03 for moneyness and h2 = 0.04 for time to maturity. This choice is justified by Table 3.2 which presents the estimates for the two Akaike information criteria (AIC) that are explained in detail in Appendix A. Both criterion functions become very flat near the minimum. Criterion AIC2 assumes its global minimum in the neighborhood of h = (0.03, 0.04) , which is why we opt for these bandwidths. In being able to choose these small bandwidths, the strength of our modelling approach is demonstrated: indeed, the bandwidth in the time to maturity dimension is so small that in a fit of a particular day, data belonging to contracts with two adjacent time to maturities do not enter together pi(u) in (7) and qi(u) in (8). In fact, for a given u , the quantities pi(u ) and qi(u ) are zero most of the time, and only assume positive values for dates i, when observations are in the local neighborhood of u . Of course, during the entire observation period I, it is mandatory that observations for each u for some dates i are made. In Table 3.2, we additionally display a measure of how the factor loadings and

display the invariant function m0, since it essentially is the zero function of the affine space fitted by the data: both mean and median are zero up to 10-2 in magnitude. We believe this to be estimation error. The remaining functions exhibit more interesting patterns: m1 in Figure 4 is positive throughout, and mildly concave. There is little variability across the term structure. Since this function belongs to the weights with highest variance, we interpret it as the time dependent mean of the (log)-IVS, i.e. a shift effect. Function m2, depicted in Figure 5, changes sign around the at-the-money region, which implies that the smile deformation of the IVS is exacerbated or mitigated by this eigenfunction. Hence we consider this function as a moneyness slope effect of the IVS. Finally, m3 is positive for the very short term contracts, and negative for contracts with maturity longer than 0.1 years, Figure 6. Thus, a positive weight in 3 lowers short term implied volatilities and increases long term implied volatilities: m3 generates the term structure dynamics of the IVS, it provides a term structure slope effect. These observations are line with the results of earlier studies on the IVS, Skiadopoulos et al. (1999), Cont and da Fonseca (2002), and Fengler et al. (2003). It is important to remark that the eigenfunctions appear quite rough, which is due the small bandwidths we use here for demonstration. Depending on the specific application, for instance the one we consider in Section 4 it may be advisable to employ somewhat larger bandwidths.
To appreciate the power of the DSFM, we inspect again the case of 20000502. In Figure 7, we compare a Nadaraya-Watson estimator (left panel) with the DSFM (right panel). In the first case, the bandwidths are increased to h = (0.06, 0.25) in order to remove all holes and excessive variation in the fit, while for the latter the bandwidths are kept at h = (0.03, 0.04) . While both fits look similar at first sight, the differences are best visible when both cases are contrasted for each time to maturity string separately, Figures 8 to 11. Generally, the standard Nadaraya-Watson fit exhibits a strong directional bias, especially in the wings. The DSFM is not entirely unbiased either, but clearly the fit is superior.
Figure 12 shows the time series of 1 to 3 and their correlograms. Summary statistics are given in Table 3 and contemporaneous correlation in the right part of Table 4. The ADF tests at the 5% level, left part of Table 4, indicate a unit root for 1 and 2. Thus, one may model first differences of the first two loading series together with the levels of 3 in a parsimonious VAR framework. Alternatively, since the results are only marginally

The estimation also includes a constant and two dummy variables, assuming the value one right at those days and one day after, when the corresponding IV observations of the minimum time to maturity string (10 days to expiry) were to be excluded from the estimation of the DSFM. This is to capture possible seasonality effects introduced from the data filter.

and dummies are weakly significant, but not shown for the sake of clarity. As is seen all factor loadings follow AR(2) processes. There are also a number of remarkable cross dynamics. Exploiting these cross dynamics is vital for the model's performance, as shall be seen in the subsequent prediction contest.

3.3 Prediction contest
We now study the prediction performance of our model compared with a benchmark model. Model comparisons that have been conducted, for instance by Bakshi et al. (1997), Dumas et al. (1998), and Bates (2000), often reveal that simple trader models perform better than more sophisticated models. These models used by professionals simply assert that today's implied volatility is tomorrow's implied volatility. There are two versions: the sticky strike assumption pretends that implied volatility is constant at fixed strikes. The sticky moneyness version claims the same for implied volatilities observed at a fixed moneyness, Derman (1999).

We use the sticky moneyness model as our benchmark. There are two reasons for this choice: first, from a methodological point of view, as has been shown by Balland (2002) and Daglish et al. (2003), the sticky strike rule as an assumption on the stochastic process governing implied volatilities, is not consistent with the existence of a smile. The sticky moneyness rule, however, can be. Second, since we estimate our model in terms of moneyness, sticky moneyness rule is most natural.
Our methodology in comparing prediction performance is as follows: as presented in Section 3.2, the resulting times series of latent factors i,l is replaced by a times series model with fitted values i,l(^) based on i ,l with i  i - 1 , 1  l  L, where ^ is a vector of estimated coefficients seen in Table 5. As in Section 2, we employ a variant of AIC1 based on the fitted values as an asymptotically unbiased estimate of mean square prediction error. The criterion is penalized with the dimension of the model, dim() = 27 (six VAR-coefficients in

This criterion, denoted by AIC, is compared with the squared one-day prediction error of the sticky moneyness (StM) model:

(Yi,j - Yi-1,j )2 .
j

(22)

In practice, since one hardly observes Yi,j at the same moneyness as in i - 1, Yi-1,j is obtained via a localized interpolation of the previous day's smile. Time to maturity effects are neglected, and observations, the previous values of which are lost due to expiry, are deleted from the sample. Running the model comparison shows:

StM = 0.00476 versus AIC = 0.00439 .
Thus, the model comparison reveals that the DSFM is approximate 10% better than the sticky moneyness model. This is a substantial improvement given the high variance in implied volatility and financial data in general.

4 Hedging in local volatility models using the DSFM

Local volatility models are one-factor models, i.e. it is assumed that the asset price dynamics are governed by the stochastic differential equation

dSt St

=

µ dt

+

(St, t) dWt

,

(23)

where Wt is a Brownian motion, µ denotes the drift, and (St, t) the local volatility function which depends on the asset price and time, only. In local volatility pricers, the IVS is

26

employed to calibrate the local volatility function to the market. Then, the BS partial differential equation with generalized volatility function is solved for pricing the exotic options, Andersen and Brotherton-Ratcliffe (1997) and Dempster and Richards (2000). Therefore, unlike to the BS model, prices depend on the entire IVS, and not simply on the implied volatility at a specific strike. In consequence, the notion of vega hedging needs to be generalized. A usual attempt to respond to this problem, is to define a so called `parallel-shift-vega' which corresponds to the sensitivity of the option price with respect to a parallel shift of the whole IVS. It is calculated via bumping the IVS by a certain factor and computing the difference quotient. From our empirical analysis, however, it is obvious that the IVS displays much more sophisticated dynamics as is manifest in the moneyness slope and term structure slope effects. While an up-and-down shift of the IVS may be the most important factor, the parallel-shift-vega leaves the slope and term structure risks, which the exotic option is exposed to, unhedged. Depending on the specific payoff profile of the option, these risks, however, can be of substantial size. For instance, for down-and-out puts, the probability of hitting the barrier is very much determined by the slope of the smile. In this case, it is desirable to hedge the slope risks of the IVS.

The DSFM gives a decomposition of the IVS into its most important factors. For pathdependent options, we therefore propose to define the hedge in terms of these factors. More precisely, given the decomposition

For

setting

up a hedge, one needs to define portfolios HP1, HP2, . . . consisting of plain vanilla options

that have approximately the same first order expansion in terms of these beta-greeks. Given

the hedge-ratios the residual delta risk is hedged with the underlying. The particular nature

of the hedge portfolio depends on the exotic option to be hedged, but may also depend on

general targets in risk management such as to reduce gamma risks.

To make our approach more precise, we concentrate on the two-factor case with two hedge portfolios HP1 and HP2 and the aforementioned down-and-out put P do. First, one computes the sensitivities of the hedge portfolios and the barrier option with respect to 1 and 2, for

27

instance via a difference quotient. The hedge ratios a1 and a2 for a `beta-neutral' hedge are obtained by solving the linear system of equations:

 HP1
1

 H P1 2

 H P2 1

 a1


 =

P do 1

 

.

 H P2 2

a2

P do 2

(25)

Equations (25) give an immediate suggestion of how to choose the hedge portfolios. Obvi-

ously, it is desirable to define HP1 and HP2 such that they have maximum exposure to 1

and

2,

respectively,

since

in

this

case,

 H P1 2

0

and

 H P2 1

 0.

For

the

down-and-out

put

considered here, a natural choice is to use a portfolio of at-the-money plain vanilla options

in HP1, and in HP2 a vega-neutral risk reversal. A risk reversal is a short position in an out-of-the-money plain vanilla call and a long position in an out-of-the-money put (or vice

versa). The value of a risk reversal primarily responds to changes in the wings of the IVS

and by selecting the appropriate strikes, it can be set up in a vega-neutral way.

We expect this `beta-hedging' approach to be superior to the usual parallel-shift-vega for a number of reasons: first, the parallel-shift-vega corresponds to a hedge in the DSFM with only one factor. Second, it mimics the rich structure of the factor surface of m1 that is visible in Figure 4, only in an insufficient way. Finally, beta-hedging allows to reduce the slope and curvature risks. Conducting a comparative hedging exercise along the lines of Bakshi et al. (1997) and Dumas et al. (1998) is topic of our ongoing research on the DSFM.

5 Conclusion
In this study we present a modelling approach to the implied volatility surface (IVS) that takes care of the particular discrete string structure of implied volatility data. The technique comes from functional PCA and backfitting in additive models. Unlike other studies, our ansatz is tailored to the degenerated design of implied volatility data by fitting basis functions in the local neighborhood of the design points only. We thus avoid bias effects. Using transactions based DAX index implied volatility data from 1998 to May 2001, we recover a number of basis functions generating the dynamics of a single implied volatility string and surface. The functions may be intuitively interpreted as level, term structure and moneyness
28

slope effects, and a term structure twist effect, known from earlier literature. We study the time series properties of parameters weights and complete the modelling approach by fitting vector autoregressive models. A three-dimensional VAR(2) describes IVS dynamics best. In a prediction contest, we compare the performance of our model with a sticky moneyness model. Finally, based on these factors, we devise a generalized vega-hedging strategy for exotic options that are priced in the local volatility framework. The generalized vega-hedging extends the usual parallel-shift vega approaches that are typically employed.

There are two important topics for further research. First, from a practical point of view the DSFM must be put into a contest of competing hedging strategies for some prime examples of exotic options, such as barriers. Second, from a theoretical point of view, the DSFM has a natural relation with Kalman filtering. Kalman filtering is a way to recursively find solutions to discrete-data linear filtering problems, Kalman (1960). For, writing our model more compactly as:

p(B)i = ui
L
Yi,j = m0(Xi,j) + i,lml(Xi,j) + i,j ,
l=1

(26) (27)

where ui and i,j are noise, and p(B) d=ef 1 - 1B - 2B2 . . . - pBp denotes a polynomial of order p in the backshift operator B, we receive the typical state-space representation. Equation (27) is called the state equation depending on a parameter vector . It relates the (unobservable) state i of the system to the previous step i-1. The measurement equation (27) relates the state to the measurement, the IVS in our case. The difference to our work is that the time series modelling of i is done after recovering it. This integrated approach is treated in Borak et al. (2005).

A Model selection

The model selection for the DSFM entails the the choice of the model size L, the bandwidth vector h, and measuring the convergence of the backfitting algorithm. This is detailed in this appendix.

For the model size we use the residual sum of squares for different L:

RV (L) d=ef

I i

Ji j

Yi,j -

L l=0

i,l

ml(Xi,j

)

2

I i

Ji j

(Yi,j

-

Y¯

)2

,

(28)

where Y¯ denotes the overall mean of the observations. The quantity 1-RV (L) is the portion

of variance explained in the approximation, and L can be increased until a sufficiently high

level of fitting accuracy is achieved. This is a common selection method also in ordinary

PCA.

For a data-driven choice of bandwidths, we propose a weighted AIC. We use a weighted criterion, since the distribution of observations is very unequal, Figure 3. This can lead to nonconvexity in the criterion and typically results into inacceptably small bandwidths, see Fengler et al. (2003) for a first description of this problem. It is natural to punish the criterion in areas where the distribution is sparse. For a given weight function w, consider:

(m0,

.

.

.

,

mL)

d=ef

1 E
N

L
{Yi,j - i,lml(Xi,j)}2 w(Xi,j) ,

i,j l=0

(29)

for functions m0, . . . , mL. The expectation operator is denoted by E. We choose bandwidths such that (m0, . . . , mL) is minimal. According to the AIC this is asymptotically equivalent to minimizing:

AI C1

d=ef

1 N

L
{Yi,j - i,lml(Xi,j)}2 w(Xi,j) exp

L 2 N Kh(0)

i,j l=0

w(u)du

.

(30)

Alternatively, one may consider the computationally more easy criterion:

AI C2

d=ef

1 N

L
{Yi,j - i,lml(Xi,j)}2 exp

L 2 N Kh(0)

w(u) du w(u)p(u) du

i,j l=0

.

35

(31)

Putting w(u) d=ef 1, delivers the common AIC. This, however, does not take into account
the quality of the estimation at the boundary regions or in regions where data are sparse, since in these regions p(u) is small. We propose to choose w(u) d=ef p-1(u), which gives equal
weight everywhere as can be seen by the following considerations:

1

(m0, . . . , mL)

=

E N

^2 w(Xi,j)

i,j

1 +E
N
i,j

L2
i,l{ml(Xi,j) - ml(Xi,j)} w(Xi,j)
l=0

 2 w(u)p(u) du

1 +
N
i,j

L2
i,l{ml(u) - ml(u)} w(u)p(u) du ,
l=0

(32)

where  denotes the residual and 2 d=ef Var().

The two criteria finally are:

AI C1

d=ef

1 N

L
{Yi,j - i,lml(Xi,j)}2 p^(Xi,j) exp

L 2 N Kh(0)

i,j l=0

1 du ,
p^(u)

and

AI C2

d=ef

1 N

L
{Yi,j - i,lml(Xi,j)}2 exp

2

L N

Kh(0)

µ-1

i,j l=0

1 du
p^(u)

,

where µ denotes the Lebesgue measure of the design set.

(33) (34)

Under some regularity conditions, the AIC is an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the mean averaged square error (MASE). In our setting it would be consistent if the density of Xi,j did not depend on day i. Due to the irregular design, this is an unrealistic assumption. For this reason, AIC1 and AIC2 estimate a weighted versions of MASE.

In our AIC the penalty term does not punish for the number parameters i,l that are employed to model the time series. This can be neglected because we will use a finite dimensional model for the dynamics of i,l. The corresponding penalty term is negligible compared to the

36

smoothing penalty term. For the prediction contest, however, we use a penalty term that

takes care of the specific parametric model of (). More precisely, for the model contest, we use criterion AIC1 with w(u) d=ef 1. This results in:

AIC d=ef N -1

I i

Ji L

2

Yi,j - i,l(^) ml(Xi,j)

j l=0

× exp

L 2 dim() 2 N Kh(0) µ + N

.

(35)

Thus, we penalize for the dimension of the model.

Clearly, the choice of h and L are not independent. From this point of view, one may think about minimizing (33) or (34) over both parameters. However, our practical experience shows that for a given L, changes in the criteria from variation in h is small, compared to variation in L for a given h. To reduce the computational burden, we use (28) to determine model size L, and then (33) and (34) to optimize h for a given L.

Convergence of the iterations is measured by

I
Qk(r) d=ef
i=1

Lk
i(r) m(lr)(u) - i(r-1) ml(r-1)(u) du .
l=0

(36)

The rth cycle of the estimation is denoted by (r). Here, we approximate the integral by simple sums over the estimation grid. Putting k = 1, 2, we have an L1- and an L2-measure of convergence. Iterations are stopped when Qk(r)  k for some small > 0.

B Dividend correction scheme

Here, we explain the dividend correction algorithm. To illustrate the aforementioned dividend problem consider Figure 13. There, for the calculation of implied volatilities, the DAX spot price has been approximated by simply discounting the DAX futures price. As is visible, implied volatilities of calls (crosses) and puts (circles) fall apart, and violate the put-call-parity. As an explanation, Hafner and Wallmeier (2001) argue that the individual tax scheme of the marginal investor can be different from the one actually assumed to compute the DAX index. Consequently, the net dividend for this investor is higher or lower than the one used for the index computation. This discrepancy, which the authors call `difference dividend', has the same impact as a dividend payment for an unprotected option, i.e. it drives a wedge into the option prices and hence into implied volatilities. Denote by Dt,T the time T value of this difference dividend incurred between t and T . Consider the dividend adjusted formula for a futures price:

Ft = erF (TF -t)St - Dt,TF ,

(37)

and the dividend adjusted put-call parity:

Ct - Pt = St - Dt,TH e-rH (TH -t) - e-rH (TH -t)K

(38)

with TH denoting the call's Ct and the put's Pt maturity date. Inserting equation (37) into

(38) yields

Ct - Pt = e-rF (TF -t)Ft + Dt,TH ,TF - e-rH (TH -t)K ,

(39)

where Dt,TH,TF d=ef Dt,TF e-rF (TF -t) - Dt,TH e-rH(TH-t) is the desired difference dividend.

The `adjusted' index level

S~t = e-rF (TF -t)Ft + Dt,TH ,TF

(40)

is that index level, which ties put and call implied volatilities exactly to the same levels when used in the inversion of the BS formula.

For an estimate of D^t,TH,TF , pairs of puts and calls of the strikes and same maturity are identified provided they were traded within a five minutes interval. For each pair the

38

Figure 13: IVS ticks on April 4, 2000, derived from futures prices that are interest rate discounted only. Put implied volatility are circles, call implied volatility crosses.
Dt,TH,TF is derived from equation (39). To ensure robustness D^ t,TH,TF is estimated by the median of all Dt,TH,TF of the pairs for a given maturity at day t. Implied volatilities are recovered by inverting the BS formula using the corrected index value S~t = Fte-rF (TF -t) + D^ t,TH,TF . Note that Dt,TH,TF = 0, when TH = TF . Indeed, when calculated also in this case, D^t,TH,TF proved to be very small (compared with the index value), which supports the validity of this approach. The described procedure is applied on a daily basis throughout the entire data set from 199801 to 200105.
In Figure 14, we present the data after correcting the discounted futures price with an implied difference dividend D^t = (10.3, 5.0, 1.9) , where the first entry refers to 16 days, the second to 45 days and the third to 73 days to maturity. Implied volatilities of puts and calls converge two one single string, while the concavity of the put volatility smile is remedied, too. Note that the overall level of implied volatility string is not altered through that procedure.
