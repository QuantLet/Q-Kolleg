Abstract
We examine intra-day market reactions to news in stock-specific sentiment disclosures. Using pre-processed data from an automated news analytics tool based on linguistic pattern recognition we extract information on the relevance as well as the direction of company-specific news. Information-implied reactions in returns, volatility as well as liquidity demand and supply are quantified by a high-frequency VAR model using 20 second intervals. Analyzing a cross-section of stocks traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSE), we find market-wide robust news-dependent responses in volatility and trading volume. However, this is only true if news items are classified as highly relevant. Liquidity supply reacts less distinctly due to a stronger influence of idiosyncratic noise. Furthermore, evidence for abnormal highfrequency returns after news in sentiments is shown.

1 Introduction
Trading on financial markets is ultimately driven by news. However, news are difficult to observe and to identify. Due to the enormous amount of information continuously released by modern electronic communication media it is virtually impossible to process all information associated with a certain financial asset. In particular, it is problematic to distinguish between relevant and less relevant news and to interpret them accordingly. Because of these difficulties nearly all empirical studies examine the impact of news by solely focusing on specific news events, such as scheduled macroeconomic announcements, political interventions, or certain firm-specific news such as earnings announcements which are in most cases easily identifiable.
This paper addresses the challenge of linking a virtually continuous asset-specific news flow to high-frequency market activity. The news flow consists of messages from an automated news sentiment engine. This engine performs a linguistic pre-processing of stock-specific public news. It transforms the news content into items indicating news' relevance and the author's sentiment of the underlying story. Exploiting this source we link stock-specific news arrivals to high-frequency returns, volatility, trading intensity, trade sizes, spreads and market depth.
The question of how news is incorporated into asset prices is analyzed by a wide range of studies. The predominant part of this literature focuses on macroeconomic news and company-specific earnings announcements. Starting with Beaver (1968), numerous studies have quantified the link between abnormal volatility and trading volume induced by the disclosure of earnings information, see, e.g., Malatesta and Thompson (1985), Landsman and Maydew (2002) or Graham et al. (2006). Comparable results are found for macroeconomic news, see, e.g., Ederington and Lee (1993), DeGennaro and Shrieves (1997), Fleming and Remolona (1999), Hautsch and Hess (2002) and Andersen et al. (2003). However, only very few studies try to link asset prices and trading activities to an intraday flow of information. This is due to the fact that highfrequency news items are difficult to record and are typically considered to be too noisy due to the interference with other sources of information. As a consequence, Berry and Howe (1994) and Mitchell and Mulherin (1994) construct aggregated news measures and document a positive relationship between the amount of news and market activity.
2

Kalev et al. (2004) use the number of public news items as an explanatory variable in a GARCH specification to test the influence of the news arrival rate on stock market volatility. Ranaldo (2008) is the only study examining the impact of single firm-specific news items on intra-day trading processes. Still, a major problem of his analysis is the vast amount of virtually non-informative news. As a result, the estimated news impact is comparably low, particularly, if earnings announcements are discarded. These results indicate that the distinction between relevant and irrelevant news as well as the filtering of noise is very crucial.
To our best knowledge, the present study is the first one exploiting data from an automated news engine. We use the Reuters NewsScope Sentiment Engine which classifies firm-specific news according to positive and negative author sentiments and provides an indicator for news' relevance. Each sentiment and relevance measure is derived from a linguistic pattern analysis of the respective news story. Supposing that the news engine captures a major part of intradaily news arrivals in a pre-filtered and structured way, it opens up a new direction to examine the effects of a continuous news flow on intraday trading. Using this data we aim to answer the following research questions: (i) Can we identify significant reactions in returns, volatility and liquidity induced by the arrival of a news item? (ii) Does the magnitude of the reactions depend on the indicated relevance and sign of news? (iii) Are the results robust across different stocks or are they overlaid by stock-specific noise? (iv) Are news in sentiments anticipated or known by the market prior to publication? (v) Is there a different reaction to sentiments on days of earnings announcements?
Using 20 second aggregates of transaction data from 35 liquid stocks traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSE), we study news' impact on abnormal returns, squared returns, cumulated trading volume, spreads and market depth. Particularly the behavior of liquidity supply and demand around news announcements is still widely unexplored. To our knowledge only Fleming and Remolona (1999) provide a systematic analysis of trading intensities, volumes and spreads around scheduled (macroeconomic) news releases. While many studies analyze news effects based on fixed windows around the event dates, we model the complete underlying trading process. To avoid spurious regression results due to neglected dynamics and cross-dependencies between the variables, we employ a high-frequency Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model which is augmented by news-specific explanatory variables and explicitly accounts for the naturally high proportion of zero variables arising from non-trading in a 20-second interval.
A major finding of our analysis is that high-frequency trading activity significantly reacts to news items which are identified as relevant. Conversely, for less relevant news
3

no significant responses can be quantified. In this sense, the sentiment relevance indicator carries information that is obviously taken into account by the market. Most distinct news effects are shown for volatility and trading volume which react strongly and fast. While volume and volatility reactions are widely stable across the market and are robust with respect to dynamics and cross-dependencies, for bid-ask spreads and market depth less distinct news effects are shown. For these variables, we observe stronger market-wide variations and generally weaker responses to news as soon as multivariate trading dynamics are taken into account. This finding is attributed to a higher impact of idiosyncratic noise and a stronger dependence on general market dynamics and thus spillovers from other trading variables. Moreover, we find evidence for significant abnormal returns after the arrival of relevant news items. This is particularly true on days of company earnings announcements. Finally, there are significant above-average market activities before the publication of an information item indicating the existence of other sources of news and an overall clustering thereof.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the underlying data set and present descriptive statistics. Section 3 reports evidence for unconditional news impacts without explicitly controlling for time series dynamics in the processes. In Section 4, the econometric framework and corresponding results based on a high-frequency VAR model are given. Section 5 concludes.
2 Data
To facilitate the processing of new information, several news vendors offer software environments capturing particular characteristics of information in real time. These tools electronically analyze available information using linguistic pattern recognition algorithms. Words, word patterns, the novelty of a news item, its type and other characteristics are translated into indicators of the relevance as well as of the tone of the item.
We use pre-processed news data from a news-analytics tool of the Reuters company, the Reuters NewsScope Sentiment Engine. The data contain all 2007 news headlines as observed on traders' screens. Each news item provides a sentiment and relevance indicator. These indicators are produced based on pattern recognition algorithms. The sentiment attributes of the news are coded +1, 0 and -1 for a positive, neutral and negative tone of the underlying story, respectively. Relevance is indicated by a number in the [0, 1] interval. News arrival is recorded based on time stamps up to a micro-second precision.

Note: RIC denotes the Reuters Identifier Code. Money Value (traded) is computed as the trade size times the respective price (turnover total in 2007 in million). Price Change is the % price change from 01/03/07 to 12/31/07. Spread and Nr. of trades are averages per trading day. The News column refers to the number of news items per firm in 2007 without overnight news and identical updates. Relevant news items are classified to be the ones with a relevance indicator greater than .5. Rel. Positive and Rel. Negative give the numbers of relevant positive and negative items, respectively. The last column gives the number of news on days of earnings announcements (EA).

We select 40 stocks from the FTSE 100 Index which are most active in terms of the number of published news items. As we require data availability for 230 trading days, the sample is ultimately cut down to 35 stocks. The fact that the selected stocks are also very actively traded (see Table 1) allows us to study market dynamics based on a high frequency.
The underlying transaction data is aggregated to 20 second intervals. We consider this aggregation level to be a good compromise between exploiting a maximum of information on the one hand and making the analysis still computationally tractable (given a year of data). To reduce the impact of market opening and closing effects, we discard the first ten and last ten minutes of a trading day. Intraday returns, volatility and liquidity are captured by the following variables computed over 20 second intervals:

(i) cumulated trade size,

(ii) average trade size, defined as the cumulated trade size divided by the corresponding number of trades per interval,

(iii) bid-ask spread evaluated at the endpoint of each interval,

(iv) mid-quote returns over each interval,

(v) money value traded, defined as trade sizes in the intervals weighted by the corresponding mid-quotes,

(vi) depth, defined as as the volume pending at the best bid and ask level, evaluated at the endpoint of each interval,

(vii) volatility, defined as the sum of squared mid-quote transaction returns over each interval.

All volatility and liquidity variables exhibit pronounced intraday trading patterns. Figure 3 shows the widely documented daily U-shape pattern for cumulated trade sizes. As shown in the Appendix, similar shapes are also revealed for the other variables. To capture theses patterns, we standardize all processes by the yearly average of the corresponding underlying 20 seconds interval, i.e.,

xjd = 1/n

xjd
n d=1

xjd

,

where j denotes the specific interval of the trading day d and x represents the corresponding variable.

Under the assumption that updates of a news story do not carry much extra information compared to the initial one, we only employ the first message from a sequence of news updates. Subsequent updates with identical headlines as the initial one are deleted from the sample. In addition, we only focus on the news flow within a trading day and do not exploit overnight news. Incorporating the latter would considerably increase the complexity of the study.
After pre-filtering, the number of news range from a minimum of 117 to a maximum of 1303 disclosures per stock in 2007 (see Table 1). We observe that news tend to cluster in the first half of a day. Figure 1 a) shows the average number of news per 5-minute interval during a trading day. It turns out that the news intensity peaks at the beginning of the trading period but is relatively stable during the rest of the day. Figure 1 b) gives the average number of news items per day through the year 2007. Similarly to the intra-day shape there is no pronounced yearly pattern.
We distinguish between different types of news. First, we separate between scheduled and non-scheduled news by identifying days on which company-specific earnings estimates are released. Second, we distinguish between relevant and less relevant news. Since we expect the reported relevance indicator to be a relatively noisy measure, we classify news items with an indicator value above or at (below) 0.6 as relevant (irrelevant) (see Figure 2).

3 Unconditional News Impacts

3.1 Impact on Volatility and Liquidity

In this section, we study the unconditional impact of the news flow without explicitly controlling for market dynamics and cross-dependencies between the variables. Such an analysis already provides important insights and serves as a basis for the econometric modelling in Section 4. Here, we analyze 400 20-second intervals around news arrivals capturing 100 intervals before each disclosure and 300 thereafter.

I-T1

News Interval 6 - Time
.... I-2 I-1 I0 I1 I2 .... IT2 Figure 4: Intervals around News Arrival

Figure 4 illustrates the timing of the intervals. I0 denotes the specific 20-second

interval around the news item, whereas T1 and T2 are the numbers of intervals before

and after the news period, respectively. For each stock, we compute the average market

reaction and corresponding standard errors over all event windows. For sake of brevity,

we refrain from showing results for individual stocks but report pooled averages over the

cross-section of stocks. Correspondingly, by denoting the market reaction of variable X

to news item i during interval Ij as XiIj , the pooled average across all news events and

all stocks is computed as XIj = 1/n

n i=1

XiIj ,

where

n

is

for

all stocks. Given that the stocks have quite similar empirical characteristics (see Table

1), this proceeding allows us to highlight the results common to all stocks. Assuming

(approximative) normally distributed reactions, the 95% confidence intervals of XIj are computed as two times the standard errors of XIj . Since these standard errors reflect variations across all event windows as well as across the market they capture overall

news responses and statistical confidence thereof. Two robustness checks underscore

the validity of the inference. First, the confidence intervals closely match those obtained

from a parametric bootstrap. Second, to account for the fact that stocks with a high

number of news naturally have a stronger weight in XIj , we perform a robustness check using a group-means estimator instead of a pooled average. The results are qualitatively

identical.1

ent types. Note that by construction of the seasonality adjustment the mean of each series equals one. We differentiate between relevant news on days with earnings announcements (henceforth EA), relevant news on days without earnings announcements (henceforth noEA) and less relevant news which virtually always occur on noEA days.
The following findings can be summarized: First, during the analyzed time window each of the variables is significantly above its mean. For instance, money value traded is on a level of more than 50% above its mean. For most variables, above-average activities start already more than thirty minutes before the item arrival. This finding is a strong hint for market participants having different and more timely sources of information and for news itself being clustered.
Second, though prior information seems to be present, relevant news items still induce significant reactions at the event time. In contrast, less relevant information does not cause any distinct market response. Hence, we find convincing evidence for the fact that market participants seem to distinguish between important and less important news and thus extract information from the sentiment ticker.
Third, we observe significant responses in volatility, bid-ask spreads and money value traded. As shown by Figure 7, spreads are significantly increased indicating that liquidity providers tend to post less competitive quotes and protect themselves against possible informational disadvantage and adverse selection. Interestingly, such behavior is not accompanied by changes in the corresponding market depth which remains relatively stable and widely unaffected by news arrivals. On the other hand, liquidity demand, as measured by the money value traded and cumulated trade sizes, significantly peaks around the event time. Interestingly, this reaction is predominantly induced by faster trading but not by higher trade sizes (see Figures 9 and 10). Moreover, we observe strong reactions in high-frequency volatility and trading volumes. Both are obviously closely related. Overall, trading activity remains on an above-average level for at least 60 minutes after news arrival.
Fourth, we observe a stronger news response on EA days than on noEA days. This might be due to the fact that news on EA days convey more information or markets are simply more sensitive.
In order to test for the existence of possible asymmetric market reactions in dependence of the sign of news, we define a sentiment indicator to have a distinct direction (positive or negative) whenever the probability p measuring the assessment's confidence exceeds 0.7. This allows us to filter out noisy and unreliable information. Figure 11 (a) shows the volatility reaction to positive and negative news items on days without earnings announcements. Figure 11 (b) depicts the volatility response to news items in-

The underlying idea is that a negative (positive) news disclosure might have a stronger impact when the recent market sentiment has been positive (negative). As depicted by both figures, we observe virtually no evidence for market reactions in volatility depending on the sign of news. This is in contrast to corresponding results based on macroeconomic announcements as reported, e.g., by Hautsch and Hess (2002) and might be explained by the existence of too much idiosyncratic noise in company-specific news. Similar findings are also obtained for the other variables.

3.2 Return Behavior
To test for abnormal returns we employ the event study framework as outlined in Campbell et al. (1997). As a model for 'normal' returns we assume the market model

Rit = i + iRmt + it,

it  (0, i2),

(1)

where t denotes the underlying (20 second) intervals, Rmt is the market return, computed as the return of the FTSE 100 index, and Rit is the return for stock i. Model

Figure 12 shows the averaged cumulated abnormal returns (ACAR) CAR employing the relevant noEA news set. We observe significantly positive cumulated abnormal returns after positive news arrivals. In case of negative relevant news arrivals ACARs

17

are surprisingly still positive, but less significant and lower in magnitude. A more distinct pattern is observed for the EA news set (Figure 13). Here, price movements are significant and in line with news' direction. This finding indicates the specific information content of news related to earnings announcements compared to other news items. Not surprisingly, less relevant news (noEA) do not induce significant abnormal returns (see Figure 14). The overall stronger reactions after positive news might be explained by the fact that during 2007 stock markets have been generally bearish making positive news items more striking than negative news.

4 Market Dynamics around News

4.1 Econometric Methodology
The unconditional analysis of the previous section provides strong indications for information-driven market reactions to news disclosures. However, as shown by Figures 15 to 17 (for a representative sample of stocks), we observe significant autocorrelations as well as cross-correlations in volatility and trading activity (see in the Appendix for the cross- and autocorrelations of the other variables). In order to avoid spurious results, these interdependencies have to be explicitly taken into account. Therefore, we suggest a four-dimensional model for the realized variance, the money value traded, the bid-ask spread and market depth. Money value traded is highly correlated with cumulated and average trade sizes and thus sufficiently captures the overall trading intensity. Moreover, as high-frequency volatility and liquidity are only weakly related to (signed) returns, we refrain from including the latter in the model. Accordingly, the vector of endogenous variables is

 



y1t money value traded

 



yt

=

y2t 

:=

y3t

   

realized volatility bid - ask spread

 . 


 



y4t market depth

(4)

The fact that even for liquid stocks there is not necessarily a transaction in every 20 second interval induces a non-trivial fraction of zero observations for money value traded and realized volatility (see Figure 18). To account for these effects, we suggest explicitly differentiating between the cases of trading, y1t > 0, and no trading, y1t = 0,

in interval t. Correspondingly, the log likelihood function is given by

T
ln L(y; 1, 2, 3) = {ln f (yt|y1t > 0; 1) + ln P(y1t > 0; 2)} · 1l (y1t > 0)
t=1 T
+ {ln P(y1t = 0; 2) + ln f (yt|y1t = 0; 3)} · 1l (y1t = 0),
t=1
where 1, 2 and 3 denote corresponding parameter sets. As long as the parameter sets 1, 2 and 3 are disjoint, the likelihood components
can be maximized separately. Since f (yt|y1t = 0; 3) is not in the core of our interest, we leave it unspecified. To parameterize f (yt|y1t > 0; 1), we suggest a VAR specification given by

p
yt|y1t > 0 = c + (iyt-i + iZt-i) +  · Dxt + t,
i=1

t  N (0, ), (5)

where i and  denote (4 × 4) and (4 × (p1 + p2 + 1)) coefficient matrices.2 Lags of the dummy Zt := 1l (y1t=0) capture previous periods of nontrading with corresponding (4 × 1) coefficient vectors i. In order to capture the time-dependent impact of news we define appropriate dummy variables

dtr = 1 in case of relevant (noEA) news in t and zero otherwise, dlt = 1 in case of less relevant (noEA) news in t and zero otherwise, deta = 1 in case of EA news in t and zero otherwise.
Then, Dtx := (dtx+p1....dxt-p2) with x  {r, l, ea} is a vector of time dummies indicating the different types of news and covering p1 intervals before and p2 intervals after news arrival. Model (5) can be consistently (though not necessarily efficiently) estimated equation by equation using ordinary least squares.
The conditional probabilities for the occurrence of zero observations (i.e., no trading) in period t, P(y1t = 0; 2), are parameterized in terms of a probit specification for the money value equation. Let xt contain all right-hand side variables of equation (5), i.e., xt := [1 yt-1...yt-p Zt-1...Zt-p Dtx]. Assuming a normally distributed

latent process y1t  N (xt2, 1) underlying the trading "decision", we have

P(y1t > 0) = (xt2), P(y1t  0) = 1 - (xt2),

if y1t > 0  y1t > 0, if y1t  0  y1t = 0,

(6) (7)

for the binary decision y1t > 0 vs. y1t = 0. The probit model is straightforwardly estimated by maximum likelihood.
The model is applied to each stock in our sample. In order to obtain equal lag structures in all equations which eases cross-sectional comparisons and the computation of cross-sectional averages, we choose a universal lag length of 10 for all stocks. This lag length is sufficiently close to the individually optimal lag length according to the Bayes Information Criterion and does not restrict the validity of the results discussed below. In the following we show the cross-sectional averages of point estimates and corresponding standard errors.

4.2 Estimation Results
In order to keep the model computationally tractable and parsimonious, the three types of news dummies Dtr, Dtl and Dtea are included separately. Since the VAR dynamics in the individual specifications are very similar, we concentrate on the estimates of the model including the noEA dummy set associated with high relevance (Dtr). Depending on the number of underlying trading days, the individual time series for the 35 stocks in the sample contain up to 369,000 observations. Table 2 reports the corresponding averaged estimates. For sake of brevity, we do not show coefficients for lags of the dependent variables greater than two. Likewise, coefficient estimates for the dummies Zt are not reported.3 News dummies cover 40 seconds before the disclosure and 100 seconds thereafter.
Analyzing the dynamics of volatility and liquidity, we can summarize the following findings: First, all variables reveal significantly positive own dynamics. This is strongly expected given the underlying autocorrelations reported above. Second, we observe a significantly positive relationship between money value traded and volatility. Hence, volatility and trading activity are closely dependent not only on a daily level as suggested by Clark (1973) and Tauchen and Pitts (1983), among others, but obviously also on a high-frequency level (see, e.g., Hautsch (2008)). Third, bid-ask spreads are higher in periods of high liquidity demand and volatility but are lower in periods of high liquidity supply (represented by the depth). Similarly, depth is lower if recent

trading activity and volatility have been high. Fourth, virtually no causalities from spreads and market depth on volatilities and volumes are observed. While liquidity demand and volatility stimulate liquidity supply, the converse relationship is thus not necessarily true.
Quantifying the average impact of news, we observe that the market reaction starts immediately after news disclosures. Due to the persistence in market dynamics information effects are carried over to subsequent periods. It is therefore not surprising that the direct impact of news as captured by the dummy variables dies out relatively quickly. It turns out that only the volatility and the trading volume are significantly (directly) affected by news. Conversely, we do not find corresponding effects for spreads and depths. These results are different to the unconditional estimates obtained in Section 3 and indicate that reactions of these variables during announcement periods are strongly induced by spill-overs from volatility and volume but do not necessarily arise from news in sentiments solely. Moreover, as shown by Table 3 depicting the corresponding results for EA news and noEA news with low relevance (indicator  0.5), we conclude that significant responses are generally only observable after the occurrence of relevant news.
Estimation results for the probit model widely confirm those for the VAR model. However, the fact that all news dummy variables are insignificant indicates that the probability for the occurrence of a trade in a 20-sec interval is not driven by news arrivals.
Though the averaged estimates capture the major features common to all assets, most stocks still reveal idiosyncratic responses to news. Figure 19 depicts the proportions of (5%) significant spread reactions to relevant noEA news for each stock in the sample. Though the average spread reaction is insignificant, we still observe significant individual spread responses for 27 out of 35 stocks in the sample. Similar results are shown (not depicted here) for market depth, whereas stock-specific effects for volatility and money value traded are more stable and in line with the average results shown above. Figure 20 reflects that the significant (positive) dummies for most stocks center around the item arrival interval. Accordingly, we can conclude that there is evidence for news-implied reactions in spreads and depth, which are, however, diffuse across the stock universe.
4.3 Impulse Response Analysis
To quantify the long-run market response to the arrival of a news item we perform an impulse response analysis. A 'news shock' is defined by a change in the news dummies.
27

As the arrival of news generally stimulates trading activity, it is sufficient to conduct the analysis given there is trading activity throughout the post-announcement periods, i.e. yj|y1j > 0 for all j = t, . . . , t + s.
Then, the response after s periods to a news arrival in t is computed as

s(1) := E[yt+s|t-1, dtx = 1; 1] - E[yt+s|t-1, dxt = 0; 1], x  {r, l, ea},
()

(8)

where t-1 represents the history of the multivariate process at t and the second term () removes the effect of constants and initial values on the response function. Let p1 = 0, p2 > 0 and ·i denote the i-th column of . Coefficients in the second to p2-th columns of  that are not significantly different from zero at the 5% level are assumed to be zero throughout. Initially we have

0 =E[yt|t-1, dxt = 1; 1] - E[yt|t-1, dxt = 0; 1]
pp
=c + (iyt-i + iZt-i) + ·1 - c + (iyt-i + iZt-i)
i=1 i=1

= ·1.

Since the initial conditions, constants and Zt cancel out, the responses in t + s, s = 1, 2, ..., to the dummy impulse in t are given as

1 = 10 + ·2, 2 = 11 + 20 + ·3, ...

Standard errors of the response function are derived using the delta method. Accordingly, s is asymptotically distributed as

s(1) d N (s(1), (1/T )Gs(  Q-1)Gs),

where Q = E[xtxt] and Gs =

s(1) 1

.

Estimates for  and Q are readily available

from the VAR estimates. Following Hamilton (1994), we construct the columns of Gs

based on finite differences according to

s(1)  s(1 + eih) - s(1) , 1i h
where h is some small number, 1i denotes the i-th element of 1 and ei is the i-th unity vector.
Figures 21 to 23 show the impulse response to news-induced dummy variable changes based on the averaged VAR estimates. The depicted reaction to relevant

Figure 23: Response Analysis of a Change in the less relevant noEA News Dummies (95% confidence intervals as dotted lines)

noEA news mimics the unconditional market responses of volatility and money value traded quite well (cf. Figures 5 and 6). Nevertheless, while the reaction of money value traded is barely significant after the first minute after news arrival, the volatility response is more persistent and lasts until the fifth minute after the event. Moreover, as shown in Figures 22 and 23, market reactions to less relevant news and EA news are not statistically different from zero.
Overall, we can conclude that the dynamic analysis widely confirms the unconditional effects shown above. Obviously, volatility and trading volume are most sensitive to news arrival. Weaker reactions and a stronger impact of idiosyncratic effects are observed in spreads and depth. In order to check the robustness of our results, we have estimated several alternative specifications, in particular (i) a simple VAR model based on 20 second aggregates (without explicitly accounting for zero observations), (ii) the corner-solution model by Cragg (1971) for the conditional density based on 20 second aggregates, and (iii) simple VAR specifications based on 5 minute aggregates. For sake of brevity we refrain from reporting the corresponding estimates in the paper. It turns out that our findings are qualitatively quite stable across the individual specifications.

5 Conclusions
Motivated by the ongoing surge in the amount of electronic news, this study analyzes the impact of firm-specific news flow on the trading activity at the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The arrival of stock-specific news items is linked to liquidity, volatility and returns for a representative sample of stocks. While previous studies dominantly focus only on a part of published firm-specific news (typically earnings announcements), this study attempts covering the complete information flow provided by a news vendor.
Recording and analyzing the overall news flow for a specific asset is challenging since the amount of news, the number of news sources and the speed of information dissemination is rapidly increasing over time. Induced by the huge amount of information permanently published in all modern media, news are overlaid by substantial noise caused by irrelevant information. To reduce the impact of noise, we make use of data provided by an automated news analytics tool of the Reuters company which allows us to disentangle relevant news from irrelevant ones and to identify the sign of news. These identifications are based on indicators from linguistic pattern recognition algorithms. Until now this kind of news data has never been systematically studied in the literature. Consequently, the induced effects on intraday trading activity, volatility and liquidity are widely unknown. This paper addresses this question and explores the impact of news on high-frequency returns, trading volume, volatility, depth and spreads by means of a high-frequency VAR model.
Based on our empirical results we can summarize the following results. First, we find significant unconditional reactions in returns, volatility and liquidity. For trading volumes and volatilities these effects remain stable even if dynamics and crossdependencies between the variables are taken into account. For market depth and spreads, news implied effects deteriorate and are less distinct in a multivariate framework. Second, market responses to information can only be identified for relevant news items. Conversely, less relevant news seems to be overlaid by noise. In this sense, our analysis confirms the usefulness of an automated linguistic pattern analysis. Third, it turns out that news impacts for individual stocks are influenced by considerable stockspecific noise. This is particularly true for the response of spreads and depth for which we find varying effects across the market. Fourth, the news impact on days of earnings announcements is different from the impact on other trading days. On these days, headlines on quarterly company earnings seem to be the dominating news reducing the importance of other information. Finally, we find evidence for market participants employing also other (sometimes more timely) news sources and for a general clustering
31

of information. This is reflected by market activity being already significantly above average before the arrival of news on sentiments.

A Note on the Computation of Standard Errors of Across-Market Averages
In the following we describe two ways of computing the mean reactions and their standard errors. The pooled average used in Section 3 is based on the model

Xi = µ + i,

i  i.i.d. N (0, 2), i = 1, .., n,

(9)

where we have suppressed the Ij index for the respective interval around the news item.

Inference is based on the pooled confidence intervals are given as

To account for the fact that the stocks have very different numbers of news items

(see Table 1), we alternatively used group-specific means. Let ns denote the number

of news for stock s and let Xsj be the reaction of a certain (trading) variable of stock

s to item j. For the average reaction of each of the nn stocks (the group mean),

Xs = 1/ns

assume

Xs = µ + s,

Both approaches have their advantages. While the latter smoothes out the effect

of a large number of news, it does not account for the within-group variation, which

is captured by (9). Hence, confidence intervals are slightly more conservative using

(10). Nevertheless, all results of Section 3 hold using both procedures. Plots of the

group-means are available upon request from the authors.
