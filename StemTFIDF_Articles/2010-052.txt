Central limit theorems for law-invariant coherent risk measures
Denis Belomestny1 and Volker Kra¨tschmer1
Abstract In this paper we study the asymptotic properties of the canonical plug-in estimates for law-invariant coherent risk measures. Under rather mild conditions not relying on the explicit representation of the risk measure under consideration, we first prove a central limit theorem for independent identically distributed data and then extend it to the case of weakly dependent ones. Finally, a number of illustrating examples is presented.

1 Introduction
In the seminal paper Artzner et al. (1999) the authors introduced the concept of coherent risk measures as a mathematical tool to assess the risks of financial positions. Formally, these objects are functionals on sets of random variables expressing risks of financial positions. The functionals should fulfill some defining properties which are axiomatic in nature to give a foundation for a normative risk assessment from the viewpoint of a regulator. An alternative axiomatic approach from the perspective of financial investors has been provided by Fo¨llmer and Schied (2004) leading to a more general notion of convex risk measures. During the last decade coherent risk measures identifying risks of financial positions with identical distributions, the so called law-invariant coherent risk measures, have become popular in some applied fields. They are building blocks in quantitative risk management (see McNeil et al. (2005)), and they have been suggested as a systematic approach for calculations of insurance premia (cf. Kaas et al. (2008)). Moreover, viewed as statistical functionals on sets of distribution functions, they satisfy the property to be monotone w.r.t. second order stochastic dominance (cf. Ba¨uerle and Mu¨ller (2006), for general information on stochastic orders see Mu¨ller and Stoyan (2002)). This illustrates the genuine intuition of risk measures as indices of distributions emphasizing the downsize risk of underlying financial positions. In practice, we are often facing the problem of estimating the values of law-invariant coherent risk measures from a time series. A customary approach is to replace the unknown distribution function with its empirical counterpart based on observed data and then to plug this estimate

into the risk measure to obtain its estimate. In this paper we are going to study the asymptotic properties of the resulting plug-in estimates. Such asymptotic analysis might be, for example, helpful for constructing confidence sets or performing statistical tests. Asymptotic properties of the plug in estimates for coherent risk measures have been investigated in two recent works, namely in Pflug and Wozabal (2010) and Beutner and Za¨hle (2010). While Pflug and Wozabal (2010) provided general results for a class of coherent risk measures in the case of independent data, Beutner and Za¨hle (2010) used a new functional delta method to obtain limit distributions for the subclass of concave distortion risk measures in the case of strongly mixing data. In both aforementioned articles the results are based on general methods which do not take into account specific properties of the law-invariant coherent risk measures, leading to unnecessary strong assumptions on the underlying distribution. The aim of this paper is to extend and systemize the results on central limit theorems for plug-in estimates of law-invariant coherent risk measures. The contribution of the paper is twofold. On the one side, we prove central limit theorems for plug-in estimates for a rather general class of coherent risk measures under less restrictive assumptions, taking into account the fact that the "loss" tails are more relevant than the"gain tails"for coherent risk measures. On the other side, in contrast to the previous literature our results do not rely on the knowledge of the specific representations for the risk measures, expressing the assumptions just in terms of the functionals itself. The last but not the least, we extend our CLT also to the case dependent observations and discontinuous distributions. The paper is organized as follows. After introducing the main setup in section 2 we shall present our main results in section 3 for independent data. These results will then be extended to the case of dependent data in section 4. Section 5 gathers some auxiliary results to prove the main results, whereas the section 6 gives their proofs. Then the following section 7 is devoted to the proofs of the main results. Some useful technical results will be formulated and shown in the appendix.
2 Main setup
Let FX be a set of distribution functions on R related to a vector space X of integrable random variables on some atomless probability space (, F, P) enclosing all P-essentially bounded ones. A mapping  : FX  R is called a law-invariant coherent risk measure if the following conditions are fulfilled.
Monotonicity: For any X1, X2  X with FX1(x)  FX2(x), x  R,
(FX1 )  (FX2 ).
Cash-invariance: For any X  X and c  R,
(FX+c) = (FX ) - c.
Sublinearity: For any X1, X2  X and 1, 2  0,
(F1X1+2X2 )  1(FX1 ) + 2(FX2 ).
Here FZ stands for the distribution function of the random variable Z. The definining properties of the coherent risk measures correspond to the well-known interpretations of them as
2

representing risk attitudes of financial investors (cf. F¨ollmer and Schied (2004), Chapter 4). Let (Xi)iN be an independent sequence of real random variables defined on (, F , P) with common distribution function F and related left-continuous quantile function qF . Additionally, define, qF (0) := qF (0+) as well as qF (1) := qF (1-). Denote by Fn the empirical distribution function based on the sample (X1, . . . , Xn) and set n(F ):= (Fn). The main goal of this paper is to study the asymptotic properties of the process ( n(n(F ) - (F )))nN. As an important tool let us consider the following mapping
 : [0, 1]  [0, 1], t  (F-B(1,t)),
where B(1, t) stands for Bernoulli r.v. with expectation t. This mapping is a distortion function, i.e. it is nondecreasing with (0) = 0 and (1) = 1, suggesting the name associated distortion function.

3 Main results
 In order to prove CLT for the process ( n(n(F ) - (F )))nN, we need the following two assumptions.

(AC) X is a Stonean vector lattice, i.e. here X  Y, X  Y  X for X, Y  X , and  satisfies

lim
k

(F-(X

-k)+

)

=

0

for

nonnegative

X



X,

lim
t0+

(t)

=

(AI) The stationary distribution function F of the sequence (Xi)iN fulfills the following integrability condition

F (x)-1/2(1 - F (x))1/2 (F (x)) dx < 
R
for some  ]0, 1/2[.

The mainresult of our study is the following theorem giving the asymptotic distribution of the process ( n(n(F ) - (F )))nN.
Theorem 3.1. Let F have a finite set D(F ) of discontinuity points such that the restriction of F to ]qF (0), qF (1)[\D(F ) is continuously differentiable with strictly positive derivative. Then under the assumptions (AC) and (AI) we may find a set S((F )) of continuous, concave distortion functions which is compact w.r.t. the uniform metric, and there exists some centered Gaussian process (G)S((F )) with continuous paths and

E G(1)G(2) =

1(F (x))2(F (y)) [F (x  y) - F (x)F (y)] dx dy

for any 1, 2   such that

3

for any two different 1, 2  S((F )), then sup G() = G(Z) for some Borel-random
S((F ))
element Z of S((F )).

The proof of Theorem 3.1 is postponed to Section 7.
Remark 3.2. As it will become clear from the proof of Theorem 3.1, S((F )) consists of continuous concave distortion functions  satisfying
0
(F ) = (F (x)) dx - [1 - (F (x))] dx.
- 0
In particular,    for any   S((F )). Remark 3.3. The condition (AC) is always fulfilled if there is some topologically complete seminorm · on the Stonean vector lattice X such that the following properties are satisfied

(1) X  Y for |X|  |Y | P - a.s.,

(2)

lim
k

Xk

= 0 whenever Xk

0 P - a.s..

(cf. Ruszczynski and Shapiro (2006)). General classes of random variables meeting these requirements are given by

Lg(, F , P) := {Y  L0(, F , P) | E g(|Y |/c) <  for some c > 0},

and Mg(, F , P) := {Y  L0(, F , P) | E g(|Y |/c) <  for all c > 0},
where g denotes any continuous Young function, i.e. a continuous, nondecreasing, unbounded, convex function g : R+  R+ with g(0) = 0. Both classes may be equipped with the respective Luxemburg seminorm · g defined by

Y g := inf c > 0 | E g(|Y |/c)  1 ,

being complete, and satisfying the conditions (1), (2) (cf. Kr¨atschmer and Za¨hle (2010)).
Let us turn now to some examples.
Example 3.4. An important class of law-invariant coherent risk measures consists of the so-called concave distortion risk measures. To recall, the concave distortion risk measure  =:  w.r.t. a concave distortion function  is defined by

0
(3) (FX ) = (FX (x)) dx - [1 - (FX (x))] dx
- 0
(cf. e.g. Denneberg (1994) or Fo¨llmer and Schied (2004)). Notice that  =  holds. The risk measure may be viewed as a Choquet integral w.r.t. the set function  P(·) (cf. Denneberg (1994)), and FX consists of all distribution functions on R such that each integral in the representation (3) is finite. The set X of random variables on (, F, P) whose distribution

4

functions belong to FX is indeed a linear space satisfying X  Y, X  Y  X for X, Y  X (cf. Denneberg (1994), Proposition 9.5 with Proposition 9.3). If, in addition,  is continuous, then



X  :=

(1 - F|X|(x)) dx

0

defines a topologically complete semi-norm on X satisfying conditions (1) and (2) (cf. Denneberg

(1994), Theorems 9.5, 8.9).

The

choice

(u)

=

1 

(u  )

with





(0, 1]

leads

to

(FX ) := 1(0,]()qX () d = AV @R(X),

where qX denote any quantile function of the distribution function FX of X. It is known as the average value at risk at level , and it is well-defined for X = L1(, F, P).
If  is continuous, and if F is as in Theorem 3.1, then the application of Theorem 3.1 along with Remark 3.2 yields that under condition (AI), the sequence ( n[n(F ) - (F )])nN converges in law to a centered normally distributed random variable with variance 2 satisfying

2 = (F (x))(F (y)) [F (x  y) - F (x)F (y)] dx dy.
R2
Example 3.5. Setting
(X) = -E[X] + a (X - E[X])- p, a  [0, 1], p  [1, [,
for all X  Lp(, F, P) we arrive at the so called one-sided moment coherent risk measure (see Fischer (2003)). The associated distortion function  satisfies (t) = t + a(1 - t)t1/p. Hence the assumption (AI) reads as follows

[F (x)(1 - F (x))]1/2 1 + a(1 - F (x))(F (x))1/p-1 dx <  for some  ]0, 1/2[,
R
which is always fulfilled in the case of

[F (x)(1 - F (x))]1/2 F (x)1/p-1 dx < .
R

Example 3.6. Let g be a strictly increasing continuous Young function satisfying g(1) = 1, and let X be the space Mg(, F, P) associated with g as in Remark 3.3. Moreover fix  ]0, 1[. It was shown in Goovaerts et al. (2004) that for every X  Mg(, F, P) and every x  R with 1 - FX (x) > 0 there exists a unique real number g (X, x) > x such that

(X - x)+ E g g (X, x) - x

= 1 - .

Therefore we may define a functional H,g on the set Fg of all distribution functions FX of random variables X from Mg(, F , P) by

H,g(FX ) := inf {g (-X, x) : x  R with 1 - F-X (x) > 0} .

5

Indeed, H ,g is a law-invariant coherent risk measure (cf. Bellini and Rosazza Gianin (2008) with Kra¨tschmer and Za¨hle (2010)) which satisfies condition (AC) in view of Remark 3.3. Moreover, it is easy to check that we have for t ]0, 1[

H,g (t)  1 

1-t t + g-1((1 - )/t))

=: ^H ,g (t),

where g-1 denotes the inverse of g (recall that we assumed the Young function g to be strictly increasing). Hence we may replace H,g with ^H,g when verifying condition (AI).

Recently, Mu¨ller has pointed out that expectiles, genuinely introduced in Newey and Powell (1987), may be viewed as law-invariant coherent risk measures (cf. Mu¨ller (2010)).
Example 3.7. The expectiles based risk measure w.r.t. to any fixed   [1/2, 1[ is defined by

(FX ) = argmin

Discussion Pflug and Wozabal (2010) studied CLT for distortion risk measures discussed in Example 3.4. Motivated by earlier results on limit theorems for L statistics they implicitely assumed that sup (t)/t <  for some  ]0, 1/2] and
t]0,1[
(4) |qF (t)|  C[t(1 - t)]-d, t ]0, 1[,
for some d ]-,  -1/2[. First, note that as opposite to (4), our assumption (AI) concerns only the left tail of the distribution F. Furthermore, the next example shows that the tail condition (4) is substantially more restrictive than condition (AI). Define via (t) := t[1 + ln(100)]/[1 + ln(100) - ln(t)] a concave distortion function which induces a concave distortion risk measure say  as in Example 3.4. It is obvious that in this case the tail condition (4) is satisfied for distributions with lower-bounded support only, in contrast to condition (AI). Indeed for  the condition (AI) reads as follows

qF (1)

1 - F (x)

dx < .

qF (0) 1 + ln(100) - ln(F (x))

Invoking the well-known expansions for the Gaussian error function, it may be seen that the above condition is satisfied for any normal distribution F .

4 Extension to dependent data
In this section we carry over the results of the previous section to the case of dependent observations X1, . . . , Xn. First, let us impose the following mixing assumption.
(AM) The sequence (Xi)iN is strictly stationary and strongly mixing with the mixing coefficients (i) satisfying
(i)  ¯0 exp(-¯1i), i  N,
for some constants ¯0 > 0 and ¯1 > 0.
Remark 4.1. As an example of stationary sequences fulfilling the mixing condition (AM) we may take ARMA processes with continuously distributed innovations (cf. Mokkadem (1988)) or GARCH processes with continuously distributed innovations and Lebesgue density being positive in a neighbourhood of zero (cf. Lindner (2008)). For further examples and general conditions see Masuda (2007). In order to extend Theorem 3.1 to dependent data we also have to modify condition (AI) and replace it by the following one.
(AI') The common distribution function F of the sequence (Xi)iN fulfills the following integrability condition:
qF (1)
F (x)-1/2-2(1 - F (x))1/2- F (x)1+ dx < .
qF (0)
for some ,  ]0, 1/2[.
We are now ready to formulate the main result of this section concerning the asymptotic distribution of n(n(F ) - (F )).
Theorem 4.2. Let F have a finite set D(F ) of discontinuity points such that the restriction of F to ]qF (0), qF (1)[\D(F ) is continuously differentiable with strictly positive derivative. Then under assumptions (AC), (AI') and (AM), we may find a set S((F )) of continuous, concave distortion functions which is compact w.r.t. the uniform metric, and there exists some centered Gaussian process (G)S((F )) with continuous paths and

E G(1)G(2) =

The proof of Theorem 4.2 may be found in section 7.

5 Auxiliary results

In this section we formulate some auxiliary results needed to prove Theorems 3.1 and 4.2.

Proposition 5.1. Under condition (AC) there exists a set  of continuous concave distortion functions which is compact w.r.t. the uniform metric on [0, 1][0,1] such that

 = sup .


The proof is delegated to Appendix B.

According to Proposition 5.1 we may restrict considerations to the risk measure  admitting

representation  = sup  for some set  of continuous concave distortion functions which

is compact w.r.t.


the uniform

metric

on

[0, 1][0,1].

Then

we

may

write

 n[n(F )

-

(F )]

=

n[sup (Fn)- sup (F )]. Let us now consider the auxiliary stochastic processes





Dn() 

(n  N), where

 Dn() := n[(Fn) - (F )] = n [(Fn(x)) - (F (x))] dx,   .
R
They have paths in the space l() defined to consist of all bounded, real-valued mappings on . Endowing l() with the uniform topology, we shall show next that the mapping Dn :   R can be viewed as a Borel random element of l(). The idea behind is to reduce the proof of the Theorems 3.1, 4.2 to a convergence in law of the sequence of (Dn)n in l(). This would
allow to apply the functional delta method for sup functionals to obtain the desired convergence results for n[n(F ) - (F )] n (see R¨omisch (2006)). Firstly, we have

(5) | (t) - (s) |  (|t - s|) for t, s  [0, 1]

(cf. Kr¨atschmer and Za¨hle (2010)). Moreover, observe that concavity of each    implies that

(6) | (t)-(s) | =

t
 (u) du
s



| (s)||s-t|  |s-t|

(s) - (s) (1 - )s

 |s-t|

((1 - )s) (1 - )s

holds for s,  ]0, 1[ and t  [s, 1], where henceforth  denotes the right-sided derivative of . The following technical auxiliary result will turn out to be useful later on.

Lemma 5.2. If either (AI) or (AI') is satisfied, then the set {(F )1]-,0]-[1-(F )]1]0,[ |   } is dominated by a mapping which is integrable w.r.t. the ordinary Lebesgue-Borel measure
on R.

Proof: We shall restrict ourselves to show the statement of Lemma 5.2 under condition (AI'), the respective proof under condition (AI) follows the same line of reasoning. Let ,  ]0, 1/2] as in (AI'). By concavity of  we have

F (x)(F (x))  (1/)  F (x)1+  (1/) F (x)-1/2-(1 - F (x))1/2- F (x)1+ F (x)1/2+(1 - F (x))-1/2

8

Hence in view of (5) we obtain for x < qF (1/2) (7) (F (x))  (2/) F (x)-1/2-2(1 - F (x))1/2- F (x)1+ .

Furthermore by (6) and concavity of 

1

1 - (F (x)) =

 (u) du  (1 - F (x)) (F (x))  (1 - F (x)) F (x)1+

F (x)

F (x)1+/2 F (x)1+

(1 - F (x))



2

 F (x)1+ F (x)1+

(1 - F (x))

for F (x) > 0. This implies for x > qF (1/2) (8) 1 - (F (x))  (2/) F (x)-1/2-2(1 - F (x))1/2- F (x)1+ .
Since {(F )1]-,0] - [1 - (F )]1]0,[ |   } is uniformly bounded, we may conclude the statement of Lemma 5.2 from (7), (8) and condition (AI').

As a first consequence of Lemma 5.2 we may show that within our setting the paths of the processes Dn()  are uniformly continuous.

Lemma 5.3. If either (AI) or (AI') is satisfied, then each process Vn() , V() , Dn()  has uniformly continuous paths w.r.t. the uniform metric. Here we use notation

 Vn() := n
 V() := n

0
(Fn(x)) dx + [1 - (Fn(x))] dx
- 0
0
(F (x)) dx + [1 - (F (x))] dx .
- 0

Proof: Since  is compact, the paths of any process Vn() , V() , Dn()  are uniformly continuous if and only if they are continuous. So it suffices to show the continuity of the paths. Let (k)k denote any sequence in  which converges to some    w.r.t. the uniform metric. Denoting the sample minimum and maximum of (X1, ..., Xn) by Xn:1 and Xn:n respectively, we may observe
k(Fn)1]-,0] - [1 - k(Fn)]1]0,[  1[Xn:10,Xn:n0].
Hence in view of Lemma 5.2, {k(Fn) - k(F ) | k  N} is P-a.s. dominated by mappings which are integrable w.r.t. the ordinary Lebesgue-Borel measure 1 on R. This shows continuity of the paths of Dn()  due to the dominated convergence theorem. The proofs of the continuity of the paths of Vn()  and V()  follow the same line of reasoning.

The uniform metric on  is separable due to compactness, so by Lemma 5.3 the mappings Dn are Borel random elements of U CB(), the space of bounded real-valued mappings on  which
are uniformly continuous w.r.t. the supremum metric, where U CB() is equipped with the supremum norm · . Hence, the map Dn :   R can be viewed as a Borel random element of l(). We shall show the following result concerning the convergence of (Dn)n.

Theorem 5.4. Let the assumptions of either Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 4.2 be fulfilled. Then there exists a tight centered Gaussian Borel random element G of U CB() with

E G(1)G(2)

= 1(F (x))2(F (y)) [F (x  y) - F (x)F (y)
R2 
+2 P(X1  x, Xk  y) - F (x)F (y) dx dy
k=1

for any 1, 2   such that Dn()  converges in law to G.

For the proof of Theorem 5.4 we shall verify the following two results whose formulations need
some preparation. By assumption on F we may find qF (0) =: a0 < a1 < ... < ar+1 := qF (1) such that F |]ai-1, ai[ is continuously differentiable with derivative fi > 0. Let us select any strictly decreasing sequence (tk)kN in ]0, F (a1-)[ which converges to inf{F (x) | F (x) > 0}. For any k we may find a vector (ko, ..., kr, k0, ..., kr) satisfying

The mapping Dnk may be viewed as a Borel random element of U CB(), following an argu-

mentation analogously to that used for the mapping Dn. We are now ready to formulate the

auxiliary results which will be used to prove Theorems 3.1, 4.2.

Proposition 5.5. Let the assumptions of either Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 4.2 be fulfilled. Then
sup |Dn() - Dnk| is a real-valued random variable on (, F , P) for arbitrary n, k  N, and

Proposition 5.6. Let the assumptions of either Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 4.2 be fulfilled, and let l(R) denote the set of bounded real-valued mappings on R which is equipped with the uniform metric. Then there exists some tight centered Gaussian Borel random element BF of l(R) satisfying

E BF (x)BF (y) = F (x  y) - F (x)F (y) + 2 P(X1  x, Xk  y) - F (x)F (y)

for every 1, 2  .

Propositions 5.5, 5.6 and Theorem 5.4 will be shown sequentially in the following section 6.

6 Proofs of Propositions 5.5, 5.6 and Theorem 5.4

Let us retake assumptions and notations from section 5. We want to carry out the announced proofs by considering the assumptions of Theorems 3.1, 4.2 simultaneously. For that purpose we shall replace respectively (AI) and (AI ) with the following condition.
(AI!) The distribution function F fulfills

qF (1)
F (x)-1/2-2(1 - F (x))1/2- F (x)1+ dx < .
qF (0)
for some  ]0, 1/2[,   [0, 1/2[.
For  = 0 condition (AI!) reduces to (AI), whereas we have (AI') if  > 0.
The assumptions of independent (Xi)iN or strictly stationary (Xi)iN with mixing coefficients ((i))iN satisfying condition (AM) may be described simultaneously by the following condition.
(AM!) The sequence (Xi)iN is strictly stationary and strongly mixing with the mixing coefficients (i) satisfying

(i)  ¯0 exp(-¯1i), i  N,

for some constants ¯0  0 and ¯1 > 0.

In the case of independent (Xi)iN we may choose ¯0 = 0.
As a starting point we may conclude from (AM!) that there is a centered Gaussian process BF := (BF (x))xR satisfying

Cov(BF (x), BF (y)) = E [BF (x)BF (y)]

random elements of D(R), converges in law to BF (see e.g. Ben Hariz (2005), Corollary 1).

11

Moreover, the induced stochastic process BF (x) xR has paths which are continuous at every continuity point of F (Corollary 1 in Ben Hariz (2005) again).

Let qF (0) =: a0 < a1 < ... < ar+1 =: qF (1) be as in the discussion preceding Proposition 5.5. Possibly changing to a suitable probability space we may assume without loss of generality that
there is a set {Zij | i  N, j  {0, ..., r + 1}} of independent random variables all having the uniform distribution on ]0, 1[ as common distribution such that {Zij | i  N, j  {0, ..., r + 1}} and (Xi)iN are independent. This allows us to prove the following result on bounds for empirical distribution functions which will be crucial for our line of reasoning.

Lemma 6.1. Let conditions (AI!), (AM!) be satisfied, and let  ]0, 1/2[ as well as   [0, 1/2[ be as in (AI!). The sample minimum of (X1, ...Xn) will be denoted by Xn:1. Then for any  ]0, 1[, we may find a constant  ]0, [, and a sequence (An)nN in F with P(An)  1 -  such that
1[Xn:1,1](x)F (x)1+1An  1[Xn:1,1](x)Fn(x)1An
for any x  R.

Proof: Let {Zij | i  N, j  {0, ..., r + 1}} be as discussed above. Then we may invoke the randomized probability integral transformation Ui of each Xi, i.e.
r+1
Ui := F (Xi) - 1{aj}(Xi)P({Xi = aj})Zij.
j=0

In this way we obtain a strictly stationary sequence (Ui)iN of random variables with the uniform distribution on ]0, 1[ as common distribution and mixing coefficients U (i)  ¯0 exp(-¯1i) with
n
¯0, ¯1 as in (AM!). Moreover, Xi = qF (Ui) a.s. so that Fn(x) = 1/n 1]-,F (x)](Ui) a.s.. The
i=1
statement of Lemma 6.1 is then a direct consequence of Inequality 12.11.2 in Shorack (2000) if
¯0 = 0, and it may be concluded from Theorem 1.3 in Puri and Tran (1980) otherwise.
Let us now turn over to the proof of Proposition 5.5.

Proof of Proposition 5.5:

Let  ]0, 1/2[,   [0, 1/2[ be as in (AI!). Firstly, sup |Dn() - Dnk()| is a real-valued random


variable as a continuous transformation of a Borel random element of U CB().

Since  is compact w.r.t. the uniform metric it has some at most countable dense subset 0.

Then we have sup |Dn() - Dnk()| = sup |Dn() - Dnk()| because the paths of Dn and Dnk



0

are continuous. In particular, for any fixed  ]0, 1[

Bnk := {sup |Dn - Dnk| > } = { sup |Dn - Dnk| > }  F ,



0

and

 gnk(x) := n sup |[(Fn(x)) - (F (x))] - [k()(Fn(x)) - k()(F (x))]|
0

 = n sup
0

Fn(x)
1]0,1[\Ik (t) (t) dt
F (x)

is indeed a random variable. The important part of the proof is to show the following statement.

12

(*) For any  ]0, 1[, there exist C > 0 and a sequence (An)nN in F with P(An)  1 -  such that

E |1An gnk(x)|2  CF (x)-1/2-2(1 - F (x))1/2- F (x)1+

for any x ]qF (0), qF (1)[ and every n  N.

Let us first see how we may conclude the statement of Proposition 5.5 from (*).

For arbitrary  ]0, 1[ choose C, (An)nN as in (*), and for x ]qF (0), qF (1)[ use notation h(x) := F (x)-1/2-2(1 - F (x))1/2- F (x)1+ . Then

 By continuous mapping theorem the convergence in law of ( n[Fn - F ])nN implies the convergence of law of (sup | n[Fn(x) - F (x)]|)nN. In particular the latter sequence is uniformly tight
xR
which implies that for any every  ]0, 1[, there is some A  F with P(A)  1 -  such that
(1A sup |[Fn(x) - F (x)]|)nN converges uniformly to 0. Since any Ik is a finite union of open
xR
intervals of R, it is then easy to verify that 1Ik (F (x))gnk(x) nN converges in probability to 0 for any x ]qF (0), qF (1)[. Moreover, (13) means that 1Ik (F (x))gnk(x)1An nN is uniformly integrable for x ]qF (0), qF (1)[, implying that 1Ik (F (x))gnk(x)1An nN converges in mean to 0 for x ]qF (0), qF (1)[. Furthermore, by (13) and condition (AI!), we may apply the dominated
convergence theorem yielding

qF (1)

So it remains to show (*).

proof of (*):

Let for  ]0, 1[ choose C > 0,  ]0, [ and (An)nN as in Lemma 6.1. First of all, since every    is concave with (0) = 0, we have  F (x)1+  F (x)(F (x)). Hence

for   An and F (x)  Xn:1(). Finally, by Lemma C.1 (cf. appendix C), we may find a constant C > 0 such that

E n[Fn(x) - F (x)]2  C2[F (x)(1 - F (x))]1-2

holds for any x ]qF (0), qF (1)[. Setting C := (2C)/, then () follows immediately from (15) and (16). The proof of Proposition 5.5 is complete.

Proof of Proposition 5.6:

Lemma A.1 (cf. appendix A) gives the following representation of Dnk

r ki 

(17) Dnk() = -

n [qFn(t) - qF (t)]  (t) dt for k  N,   ,

i=0 ki

where qFn denotes the left-continuous quantile function of Fn. Representation (17) suggests to apply already known asymptotic results for the quantile processes ( n[qFn(t) - qF (t)])t]0,1[.
 Firstly, we already have convergence in law of ( n[Fn - F ])nN to some tight centered Borel random element BF of D(R) with covariance function satisfying (11), and whose paths are

continuous at every continuity point of F. Furthermore, by construction, we may find for any

k  N some positive constant k > 0 such that F |]qF (ki) - k, qF (ki) + k[ is continuously

differentiable with derivative fki > 0 for i = 0, ..., r.

Before proceeding, we need some notations. Setting aki := qF (ki)-k and bki := qF (ki)+k, we

r

denote the real vector space of restrictions of members of D(R) to Jk := [aki, bki] by D(Jk), and

i=0

we endow it with the sup norm. The subset D1(Jk)  D(Jk) is defined to consist of all restrictions

of distribution functions on R to Jk. Finally, l([k0, k0])×...×l([kr, kr]) stands for the set of

mappings (g0, ..., gr) : [k0, k0] × ... × [kr, kr]  Rr+1, whose components are bounded. It will

r

be equipped with the metric d, defined by d((g0, ..., gr), (h0, ..., hr)) :=

sup |gi(t) - hi(t)|.

i=0 t[ki,ki]

 Next, we obtain from the continuous mapping theorem that ( n[Fn - F ]|Jk)nN, as a sequence of Borel random elements of D(Jk) converges in law to the tight centered Gaussian Borel random

14

element BF k := BF |Jk which has continuous paths. Therefore, in view of Lemma 21.4 in van der Vaart (1998), we may apply the functional delta method (see Theorem 20.8 in van der Vaart (1998)) to the mapping

k : D1(Jk)  l([k0, k0]) × ... × l([kr, kr]), G|Jk  (qG|[k0, k0], ..., qG|[kr, kr]),

where qG denotes the left-continuous quantile function of G, to conclude that the sequence n[k(Fn|Jk) - k(F |Jk)] nN converges in law to the tight Borel random element

-

Then by (17), the application of the continuous mapping theorem yields that (Dnk)nN converges in law to some tight Borel random element Gk of l(), defined by

r
Gk() :=
i=0

ki BF (qF (t))  (t) dt. ki fki(qF (t))

Since by construction, F |]aki, bki[ is invertible for every i  {0, ..., r}, we obtain by change of variable formula

r

Gk() = BF (x) 1]qF (ki),qF (ki)[(x) (F (x)) dx = BF (x)1Ik (F (x)) (F (x)) dx.

R i=0

R

Moreover, the set of Borel probability measures on U CB() is a Polish space because U CB(), equipped with the uniform metric, is a Polish space too. Since, each Dnk is a Borel random elements of U CB(), the stochastic process (Gk()) has continuous paths a.s., and then Gk is as required.

Theorem 5.4 may be concluded from Propositions 5.5, 5.6 in the following way.

Proof of Theorem 5.4:

Let l(R) be the space of bounded real-valued mappings on R which is equipped with the uniform metric. Furthermore let BF be the Gaussian Borel random element of l(R) from

Proposition 5.6, inducing a sequence (Gk)kN of Gaussian Borel random elements of U CB() as in Proposition 5.6.

Since the mappings Dn, Dnk are Borel random elements of a separable metric space we may

apply Theorem 4.2 in Billingsley (1968). Therefore, in view of Propositions 5.5, 5.6 it remains

to show that the mapping G() :=

qF (1) qF (0)



(F (x))BF (x)

dx

defines

a

Borel

random

element

G

of U CB() such that (Gk)k converges in law to G.

Let ,   [0, 1/2[ as in condition (AI!). Then by Lemma C.1 (cf. appendix C), there exists some constant C  0 such that Var(BF (x))  C2[F (x)(1 - F (x)]1-2 for every x  R. Then we may

15

conclude from (6) along with (AI!)

By Lemma 3.3 in Rajput (1972), this means that BF has paths in V almost surely, where V

denotes the set of all g  l(R) such that g F 1+ /F 1+ is integrable w.r.t. the ordinary

Lebesgue-Borel measure 1 on R. By the same argument from Rajput (1972), (G()) is

a well-defined centered Gaussian process.

Moreover,

lim

for

Since every process (Gk()) has paths in U CB(), (18) tells us that (G()) has paths in U CB() a.s.. So we may choose an indistinguishable version of (G()) as a centered Gaussian Borel random element of U CB(), denoted by G, which is in addition tight because the uniform topology on U CB() is separably and completely metrizable. Finally, (18) also implies that (Gk)kN convergese in law to G. The proof is complete now.

7 Proof of the main results
Let us retake notions and notations from sections 3, 4. First of all, assumption (AC) on the risk measure  allows us to apply Proposition 5.1. Therefore,  = sup  for some set  of continuous concave distortion functions which is compact w.r.t.

the uniform metric on [0, 1][0,1]. The compactness of  implies by an exercise of dominated convergence theorem along with Lemma 5.2
(19) S((F )) := {   | (F ) = (F )} =  and compact w.r.t. uniform metric
under (AI) or (AI').
Now, let (Dn)nN be the sequence of Borel random elements of U CB() defined as in section 5. Each of them may be decomposed in the following way
 (20) Dn() = n[(Fn) - (F )].
According to Theorem 5.4, if the assumptions of either Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 4.2 are satisfied, then there exists a tight centered Gaussian Borel random element G of U CB() with

16

E G(1)G(2)

= 1(F (x))2(F (y)) [F (x  y) - F (x)F (y)
R2 
+2 P(X1  x, Xk  y) - F (x)F (y) dx dy
k=1

for any 1, 2   such that Dn()  converges in law to G. As a further consequence, (20)

along with representation  = sup  and (19) allows us to apply the functional delta method





for sup functionals (cf. Ro¨misch (2006)) to conclude that n[n(F ) - (F )] nN converges in

law to sup G. Finally, if E (G(1) - G(2))2 = 0 for different 1, 2  S((F )), then it is

S()

well-known that the paths of G|S((F )) have unique maximizers a.s. (cf. Lifshits (1982)). Then

by measurable selection we may find a Borel random element Z of S((F )) such that G(Z) is

distributed as sup G. This completes the proof.

Then we may conclude the statement of Lemma A.1 from (21) and (22) by applying the change of variable formula to (21).

B Proof of Proposition 5.1

The proof of Proposition 5.1 relies on the following lemma.

Lemma B.1. If in addition X  Y, X  Y  X for X, Y  X , then the first property of condition

(AC) implies

(X )

sup
mN

inf

(F[X + k]-[X - m] )

X  X.

19

Proof:

In view of Proposition 6.6 from Kra¨tschmer (2007) the first property of condition (AC) al-

lows us to apply Lemma 6.5 from the same paper. According to Lemma 6.5, .1, we have

sup (FX+-[X-m])
mN

=

(FX ),

whereas

inf
kN

(F[X

+

k]-[X

-

m]

)

=

(FX + -[X - m] )

holds

for

any

m  N due to Lemma 6.5, .2. The statement of Lemma B.1 is obvious now.

Lemma B.1 enables us to conclude a robust representation of  by concave distortion risk measures when its restriction to {FX | X  L(, F , P)} admits such a representation.

Lemma B.2. Let  be any set of concave distortion functions such that (FX ) = sup (FX )

holds for X  L(, F , P).
If X  Y, X  Y  X for X, Y  X , and if  satisfies the first property of condition (AC), then
(F ) = sup (F ) is valid for arbitrary F  FX .


Proof:
Let us set  := sup . The proof is divided into two steps: First we will show that  is well-

defined and defines a law-invariant coherent risk measure on FX , which obviously concide with  on {FX | X  L(, F , P)}. Second we shall prove that both risk measures are even identical. Step 1. If we can show that (FX )  R (for all   ) and sup (FX ) <  for all X  X , then it follows easily that  defines a law-invariant coherent risk measure on X , since
every concave distortion risk measure  is a law-invariant coherent risk measure. Of course,
the mentioned conditions hold if we can show

0

(23) sup

(FX (x)) dx  (F-X-) and     :

[1 - (FX (x))] dx < 

 -

0

for all X  X with distribution function FX . To verify the first statement in (23), we pick X  X . For every    we have

(F-X- (x))



lim inf
m

(F-[X-m](x))

at every continuity point x < 0 of the distribution function F-X- of -X-, since  as a concave function is lower semicontinuous. Using this and applying Fatou's lemma, we obtain

Hence the first statement in (23) holds indeed. To verify the second statement in (23), we pick X  X . As  is nondecreasing and concave its restriction to ]0, 1] is continuous, so that

1 - (FX (x)) = (1) - (FX (x))   (FX (x0))[1 - FX (x)]  x  x0,

20

for any x0 > 0 such that FX (x0) > 0. Moreover, the integral 0[1 - FX (x)]dx exists since X  L1(, F , P). Hence,

 x0



[1 - (FX (x))] dx  [1 - (FX (t))] dx +  (FX (x0)) [1 - FX (x)] dx < .

00

x0

This shows that the second statement in (23) holds, too.

Step2. The first property of assumption (AC) on  ensures that the right-hand side of

(23)
0  (F-(X-r)+ )  (F-(X-r)+ )

converges to 0, as r  , for every nonnegative X  X . Therefore the first property of condition (AC) is fulfilled by  too, and Lemma B.1 applied to  implies  =  on X . The proof is now complete.

Now we are ready for the proof of Proposition 5.1.

Proof of Proposition 5.1: Possibly changing to a suitable probability space we may assume that L2(, F, P) is separable. Then in the specified setting, Corollary 4.72 in F¨ollmer and Schied (2004) along with Theorem 2.1 in Jouini et al. (2006) yield the existence of some set  of concave distortions such that (FX ) = sup (FX ) holds for X  L(, F , P). Notice that all members of the topological

closure  of  w.r.t. the uniform metric are concave distortion functions again. Therefore, in
view of (5) |(q) - (q)|  (q - p) for    and 0  p < q  1.

Since

by

the

we

may

conclude

that



is

uniformly equicontinuous w.r.t. the uniform metric, which means by Arzela-Ascoli theorem that

it is not only closed but also compact w.r.t. the sup metric. We want to show that  admits

a robust representation by concave distortion risk measures with concave distortions from .

For this purpose by Lemma B.2 it suffices to show that (FX ) = sup (FX ) is valid for every

X  L(, F , P).

Indeed for any fixed X  L(, F , P) with distribution function FX there exists some  > 0

such

0

(FX ) = (FX )(x)) dx - [1 - (FX (x))] dx for all   .
- 0

Then a routine application of the dominated convergence theorem yields the continuity of the

mapping

Therefore

 which converges to some  w.r.t. the uniform metric. Hence obviously, (FX ) = sup (FX ),


and thus  = sup  due to Lemma B.2. The proof is complete.

C Appendix

Lemma C.1. Let (Zi)iN be a strictly stationary, strongly mixing sequence of random variables on some probability space (, F~, P) with common distribution function H and mixing coefficients (i) satisfying

(i)  ¯0 exp(-¯1i), i  N,

for some constants ¯0 > 0 and ¯1 > 0. Then for any  ]0, 1[, there is some constant C such that

|H(x)(1 - H(x)) + 2 P({Z1  x, Zi+1  x}) - H(X)2  C[H(x)(1 - H(x))]1-
i=1

for every x  R.

Proof:
Let  ]0, 1[, x  R, and define Yi(x) := 1]-,x]  Zi. Without loss of generality we may assume ¯0  1. Firstly observe

n n-1
1/n Var( Yi(x)) = Var(Z1) + 2 (n - i)/n Cov(Z1, Zi+1)
i=1 i=1 n-1
= H(x)(1 - H(x)) + 2 (n - i)/n P({Z1  x, Zi+1  x}) - H(x)2
i=1

for any n  2. By assumption on ((i))iN the series Cov(Zi, Zi+1) converges absolutely (c.f.
i=1
e.g. Athreya an Lahiri (2006), Proposition 16.3.1) so that by dominated convergence theorem

n

Yi(x)) = H(x)(1 - H(x)) + 2

P({Z1  x, Zi+1  x}) - H(x)2 .

i=1 i=1

n
Moreover, we may apply Theorem 1.2 in Rio (1993) to Var( Yi(x)) yielding
i=1

n1
1/n Var( Yi(x))  4 -1(u/2)Q(u)2 du,
i=1 0

where Q(u) := sup y  R | P({|Y1(x)| > y}) > u and -1(u/2) := sup{i  N | (i) > u/2} (sup  := 0).
It is easy to check that Q(u) = 1 if H(x) > u and Q(u) = 0 otherwise. Moreover, by assumption on ((i))iN, we obtain -1(u/2)  [ln(2¯0) - ln(u)]/¯1. Thus

(25)

1/n Var( Yi(x))  4
i=1

H (x)
[ln(2¯0) - ln(u)]/¯1

du

=

4

H(x)[1 - ln(H(x)/(2¯0))] . ¯1

Using an analogous line of reasoning, an additional application of Theorem 1.2 in Rio (1993) to

n

Var( [1 - Yi(x)]) leads to

i=1

(26)

n
1/n Var( Yi(x))  4

[ln(2¯0)

- ln(u)]/¯1

du

=

4

[1 - H(x)][1 - ln((1 - H(x))/(2¯0))] . ¯1

Since

we

may

find

some



]0, [

such

that

ln(t/(2¯0))]

t [1

ln(t

/(2¯0))]

=

(2¯0) exp( - 1)  2¯0 exp( - 1) . 

Hence by (25), (26)

n
1/n Var( Yi(x))



8¯0 exp( - 1) 

H(x)1-  (1 - H(x))1-

i=1

 8¯0 exp( - 1) 21-[H(x)(1 - H(x))]1- 

 16¯0 [H(x)(1 - H(x))]1-. 

Then in view of (24) we may conclude


H(x)(1 - H(x)) + 2

P({Z1  x, Zi+1  x}) - H(x)2

 16¯0 [H(x)(1 - H(x))]1- 

i=1

for every x  R, which completes the proof.
