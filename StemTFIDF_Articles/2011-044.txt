Abstract
We introduce a long memory autoregressive conditional Poisson (LMACP) model to model highly persistent time series of counts. The model is applied to forecast quoted bid-ask spreads, a key parameter in stock trading operations. It is shown that the LMACP nicely captures salient features of bid-ask spreads like the strong autocorrelation and discreteness of observations. We discuss theoretical properties of LMACP models and evaluate rolling window forecasts of quoted bid-ask spreads for stocks traded at NYSE and NASDAQ. We show that Poisson time series models significantly outperform forecasts from ARMA, ARFIMA, ACD and FIACD models. The economic significance of our results is supported by the evaluation of a trade schedule. Scheduling trades according to spread forecasts we realize cost savings of up to 13 % of spread transaction costs.

1 Introduction
Bid-ask spreads reflect the fundamental costs of immediate trading, i.e., the cost of constantly guaranteeing a counterparty for trades to market participants. They are an important determinant of liquidity on stock markets and thus play a dominant role in the literature on market microstructure and stock trading. Theoretical models on market making along the lines of Copeland and Galai (1983), Kyle (1985), Glosten and Milgrom (1985) and Easley and O'Hara (1992) emphasize the adverse selection component in bid-ask spreads indicating information asymmetry among market participants. Based on game-theoretical dynamic models, Foucault (1999) and Foucault et al. (2005) argue that the bid-ask spread is the dominant parameter for the decision between different order types on stock markets. Traders can either be patient and submit limit orders or cross the spread and pay the bid-ask spread. Empirical studies confirm that limit and market order submission strategies indeed depend strongly on quoted spreads, see Biais et al. (1995), Harris and Hasbrouck (1996), Ranaldo (2004), Anand et al. (2005), Hall and Hautsch (2006) and Pascual and Veredas (2009).
Despite the importance of bid-ask spreads in trading applications and the relevance of spread predictions for the reduction of transaction costs, the question of how to statistically model bid-ask spreads has not been systematically addressed yet. Our paper is the first contribution establishing a concise econometric methodology for modeling and forecasting bid-ask spreads on a high frequency.
Due to the discreteness of prices, bid-ask spreads are multiples of minimum price changes and hence form a time series of count variables. We observe that spreads reveal a pronounced seasonality pattern and are strongly serially dependent. Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) (GPH) tests indicate that the bid-ask spread time series exhibit long range dependence. To capture these empirical properties we introduce a novel count data model - the long memory autoregressive conditional Poisson (LMACP) model. Discussing empirical and theoretical properties we show that the model is suitable for the analysis and prediction of strongly persistent discrete time series.
Traditional approaches, such as Glosten and Harris (1988), George et al. (1991),

Huang and Stoll (1997) and Bollen et al. (2004), decompose bid-ask spreads into their adverse selection, inventory holding and transaction components but are silent regarding their dynamic properties. Conversely, more recent time series approaches typically model bid-ask spreads implicitly in models for bid-ask quotes. Engle and Patton (2004) and Hautsch and Huang (2010), for instance, estimate error correction models for bid and ask quotes with the bid-ask spread serving as cointegration relation. Hasbrouck (2000) models the dynamics of bid- and ask quotes separately but does not explicitly focus on the spread. Based on a vector autoregression framework, Taylor (2002) is the only approach deriving spread forecasts.
Our study contributes to the recent literature on high frequency liquidity forecasting. See, e.g., Brownlees et al. (2010) on volume forecasts and H¨ardle et al. (2009) on forecasts of limit order book curves. Furthermore, the proposed LMACP model contributes to the literature on dynamic count data models as in Rydberg and Shephard (1999), Heinen (2003), Fokianos et al. (2009) and Ferland et al. (2006) among others. Finally, our study is related to count data predictions as in Sutradahar (2008), Jung et al. (2006) and Freeland and McCabe (2004).
Our forecast study is carried out based on representative stocks from the mid cap sector of the US Russell 3000 universe. We report rolling-window forecasts for quoted spreads on a 30 second frequency. The forecast evaluation of point and direction forecasts shows that LMACP models outperform competitors such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA), autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA), autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) and fractionally integrated autoregressive conditional duration (FIACD) models. Four main results emerge from the analysis. First, we show the importance of explicitly addressing the discrete nature of bid-ask spreads. In particular, approaches based on continuous distributions are outperformed by Poisson models in terms of point, density and direction forecasts. Second, long memory specifications widely perform better than their short memory counterparts in terms of the root mean squared error and the directional accuracy. Third, additional predictors motivated from market microstructure theory, such as trading volume, volatility, first level depth and order imbalance improve forecasts. Fourth, an economic evaluation of a simple trading scheme reveals significant cost savings of up to 13 % when the trading schedules take bid-ask spread forecasts into account.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives descriptive statistics. In Section 3, we outline the econometric model. Section 4 describes the forecasting setup and corresponding evaluation criteria. In Section 5, the forecasting results are presented. Finally, Section 6 concludes.
2 Properties of Bid-Ask Spreads
2.1 The Bid-Ask Spread as a Liquidity Measure
Trading on financial markets requires the presence of a counterparty for trades. According to theoretical models along the lines of Copeland and Galai (1983) and Glosten and Milgrom (1985), liquidity suppliers like market makers, dealers or participants submitting limit orders act as intermediaries and mitigate the search costs by offering immediate trade execution.1 Empirical studies like Glosten (1987), Glosten and Harris (1988) and Huang and Stoll (1997) suggest that quoted bid-ask spreads are measures of the costs of order processing, inventory holding and adverse selection incurred by these liquidity providers. Liquidity suppliers recoup their own costs in time t by purchasing at the bid price Bt and selling at a higher ask price At. As a measure of immediate trading and hence liquidity costs, the quoted bid-ask spread St in t is thus given by St := At -Bt, where the quotes At and Bt are given as multiples of 0.01 (price ticks). A closely related measure is the effective spread, given as StB := Pt -Bt for buyer-initiated trades and StA := At - Pt for seller-initiated trades, where Pt is the transaction price (in multiples of 0.01).
The importance of bid-ask spreads as liquidity measures for practitioners is reflected in limit order submission strategies employed by market participants to reduce trading costs. Limit and market order submission strategies depend strongly on quoted spreads and quoted depth as outlined in Biais et al. (1995), Harris and Hasbrouck (1996), Griffiths et al. (2000), Anand et al. (2005), Parlour (1998), Ranaldo (2004) and Pascual and Veredas (2009).

2.2 Empirical Properties
Histograms of spread distributions substantially vary over the Russell 3000 cross-section of the market at NYSE and NASDAQ. We show histograms for a large cross-section for January to February 2008 in the web appendix to the paper, http://amor.cms. hu-berlin.de/~grosskla/index.html. In our empirical analysis, we exclude stocks revealing "trivial" spread distributions with spreads being virtually constant to one tick. Rather, we focus on stocks with an average spread of more than two ticks revealing more dispersed distributions. The latter still cover a large fraction of the Russell 3000 index. Figure 1 shows that the average quoted spread for the constituents of the S&P 500 in 2010 is above 2. Moreover, as shown in Figure 1, average bid-ask spreads significantly vary over time. Particularly during the peak of the financial crisis in fall 2008, average spreads nearly doubled compared to the level before.

In the paper, we present results for four stocks from the mid-cap sector of the Russell index for January and February 2008 (GXP.N, EMN.N (traded at NYSE) and XRAY.OQ, EQIX.OQ (traded at NASDAQ)). The stocks are chosen to be representative for stocks below the big-cap sector of the Russell as well as for stocks of the big-cap sector with an average spread above two ticks. Figure 2 shows the distributions and snapshots of the time series evolution. Additional and robustifying results for a wide cross-section of stocks are provided in the web appendix.
Due to the discreteness of price ticks (as multiples of 0.01), a time-ordered sequence of quoted bid-ask spreads multiplied by 100 forms a time series of count variables. Table 1 gives descriptive statistics for the 30 second spread time series of the selected stocks. We observe that spread distributions can be both over- and underdispersed, i.e., have

variance above or below the means. As shown in Figure 3, the autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of bid-ask spread series decay very slowly and indicate long range dependence. In light of the bid-ask spread as a cointegration relation between ask and bid quotes (see Engle and Patton (2004) and Hautsch and Huang (2010)), these results mean that deviations from equilibria are very persistent.

where   (0, 1), c > 0 and j denotes the jth order autocorrelation, see, e.g., Beran (1998). An immediate consequence is that autocorrelations are not absolutely summable. Long range dependence is often found in financial market data (see, among many others, Ding and Granger (1996), Andersen et al. (2003) and Corsi (2009) for volatility data, Lux and Kaizoji (2007) for traded volumes and Deo et al. (2010) for trade durations) as well as in macroeconomic time series (see Bhardwaj and Swanson (2006) for an overview). The presence of long range dependence in spreads is supported
 by Figure 4 showing a convergence rate of the mean slower than n for two of the four stocks. More formally, we conduct the Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) (GPH) test for long memory, which is is based on the spectral regression

shows that the estimates of the long memory parameter b are significant and in the

range (0, 0.5). This indicates that the series is covariance stationary but long range

dependent.

As reflected by Figure 5, we observe pronounced intraday periodicities in line with

Chan et al. (1995) as well as Chung et al. (1999). Bid-ask spreads are increased in

the beginning of a trading day and decline in the course of the trading session. Such

a pattern is explained by a higher adverse selection component in spreads due to the

processing of overnight information in the morning.

3 An Econometric Model for Bid-Ask Spread Dynamics
Traditional approaches for time series of count variables are parameter-driven models based on Zeger (1988), Bayesian count data models in the spirit of Harvey and Fernandez (1989), Hidden Markov models (see MacDonald and Zucchini (1997)) or integer autoregressive moving average (INARMA) models (see McKenzie (2003)). Though conceptually elegant, these approaches suffer from tedious estimation procedures which makes them intractable in extensive high-frequency applications. As an alternative, the more recent literature focusses rather on observation-driven models, such as the autoregressive conditional Poisson (ACP) model as introduced by Rydberg and Shephard (1999) and put forward by Heinen (2003), Fokianos et al. (2009) and Ferland et al. (2006). In contrast to the aforementioned models, ACP models are straightforward to estimate and tractable even for a large number of observations. Moreover, in contrast to Hidden Markov Models or the Autoregressive Multinomial Model proposed by Engle and Russell (2005), the ACP does not require to specify the states of the dependent variable prior to the estimation.

3.1 The Autoregressive Conditional Poisson model
Since bid-ask spreads are strictly positive but the Poisson distributions (and extensions thereof) are defined on N  {0}, we follow Rydberg and Shephard (2003) and shift the spread distributions without loss of generality by one tick to the left. Accordingly, the spread process is re-defined as St := {(spread in number of ticks) - 1}.
Let P(t) denote the Poisson distribution with mean t and let Ft denote the information available in t. Moreover, let two polynomials  and  be given as (B) := 1B + 2B2 + ... + qBq and (B) := 1B + 2B2 + ... + pBp, where B is the backshift operator and i > 0, i = 1, .., q, as well as i > 0, i = 1, .., p. Then, the autoregressive conditional Poisson process {St}tZ is given by

St|Ft-1  P(t),  t  Z, t = c + (B)St + (B)t,

(3)

where c > 0. Under (3) the conditional probability mass function of St = s, s = 0, 1, 2, ..

P(St

As shown by Ferland et al. (2006), the series {St} is covariance stationary as well as

Fokianos

et

al.

(2009)

derive

the

conditions for a covariance stationary ACP process in the case q = p = 1.

Rearranging (3), the ACP mean equation can be rewritten as an ARMA(max{p, q}, p)

specification of the form

(1 - (B))

St

-

(1

c - (1))

= (1 - (B))t,

(5)

with (B) := (B) + (B) and t := St - t being a martingale difference sequence. As discussed by Ferland et al. (2006), the autocorrelation functions of the representations (5) and (3) are identical which makes it appropriate to interpret (3) as a conditional mean rather than a conditional variance model3.
While the mean and variance of the ACP process (3) are assumed to be conditionally equal, the variance of the ACP process is unconditionally greater or equal to the unconditional mean. As shown by Heinen (2003), in case of q = p = 1 we have

E[St]

c (1

Var[St]

E[St].

(6)

Hence, the ACP specification can generate unconditional overdispersion and the marginal distribution of St is no longer Poisson.
To account for the possibility of both conditional as well as unconditional overdispersion and underdispersion, Heinen and Rengifo (2007) propose using the Double Poisson distribution proposed by Efron (1986) and defined by

P(St = s|t, ) = c(, t) · 1/2e-t

3Recall, that under the Poisson assumption t equals both the conditional mean and the conditional variance.

11

The Double Poisson distribution nests the Poisson for  = 1.

Accordingly, a so-called Autoregressive Conditional Double Poisson (ACDP) model

is given by

St|Ft-1  DP(t, ), t  Z,

(9)

where DP denotes the Double Poisson distribution and t is parameterized as in (3).

The conditional variance of the ACDP model is given by Var[St|Ft-1] = t/ with  > 1

( < 1) reflecting conditional underdispersion (overdispersion). As shown by Heinen

(2003), the Double Poisson assumption can overcompensate the overdispersion gener-

ated by the dynamic mean specification resulting in unconditional underdispersion. In

particular, in the case p = q = 1, the ACDP generates unconditional underdispersion

3.2 Long Memory Autoregressive Conditional Poisson Models
To account for long range dependence in spread series, we propose two types of long memory autoregressive conditional Poisson models. Both specifications capture hyperbolically decaying autocorrelation functions and are motivated by recent advances in long memory volatility models.
A building block of a long memory model is the fractional differencing operator (1- B)d (see Hosking (1981)) which is a polynomial defined in terms of the hypergeometric

j=0

(11)

The two types of models considered below differ in the way how (1-B)d enters the conditional mean specification which has strong implications for the existence of first and second unconditional moments. Practically they differ by providing different forecasts which is analyzed in depth in Section 5.

1) LMACP Type I
The so-called Long Memory ACP (LMACP) type I specification is obtained by augmenting the ARMA representation (5) by (1 - B)d resulting in

(1 - B)d(1 - (B))(St - ) = (1 - (B))t,

(12)

where   R0+. The polynomials  and  are defined as in (5) with the roots of (1 - (B)) and (1 - (B)) lying outside the unit circle. In the GARCH case, a corresponding specification has been proposed by Karanasos et al. (2004) based on an ARMA representation of GARCH processes and is closely related to the models by Zaffaroni (2004), Koulikov (2003) and Giraitis et al. (2004).
Expressing (12) in terms of t, a LMACP type I process is obtained by

Accordingly, the long memory autoregressive conditional

Double Poisson (LMACDP) model is given by St|Ft-1  DP(t, ), t  Z with

t = (B)St and nests the Poisson case for  = 1.

13

Based on the representation

t =  + ((B) - 1) t,

(B) := (1 - (B))-1 = iBi,
i=0

(15) (16)

we observe that  corresponds to the unconditional mean and is finite. Conditions for the non-negativity of the conditional mean t are identical to those
for long memory GARCH or fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) processes (Baillie et al. (1996)). In the case 0 < 1 < 1 and p = q = 1 we have:

Proposition

1.

Let

fi

=

i-1-d i

for

i = 1, 2, ..

and

let

1

= 1 + 1.

The

conditional

mean of the LMACDP with order p = q = 1 is nonnegative a.s. if 0 < 1 < 1 and

either 1  0 and 1  f2 or for k > 2 with fk-1 < 1  fk it holds that k-1  0.

Proof. See the proof in Conrad and Haag (2006) for FIGARCH models which directly applies to the mean specification of the long memory (Double) Poisson.

The next proposition establishes the unconditional variance Var[St]. Notably, in contrast to the fourth moment of long memory GARCH models the second moment of St exists without imposing additional conditions on the process St.

Proposition 2. The unconditional variance of the long memory autoregressive conditional Double Poisson model type I is given by

Var[St] =

1 

E[t

(17)

Proof. See the appendix.

Accordingly, in the LMACP model ( = 1), the dynamic specification induces

unconditional overdispersion since

thus

Likewise

Finally, from the representation St =  + (B)t we straightforwardly get the

n-order autocorrelation as

n(St) =

j=0

j+n j2

.

(18)

Consequently, the LMACDP type I model is covariance stationary for 0 < d < 0.5.6

Using j  Cjd-1 for high j we have n(St)  Cn2d-1 which in turn implies that

limn

n k=0

|k(St)|

is

divergent.

2) LMACP Type II
The LMACP type II model is motivated by the specification of a FIGARCH model for volatility processes and the fractionally integrated autoregressive conditional duration (FIACD) model proposed by Jasiak (1998). It builds on the following representation of the conditional mean,

(1 - (B))(1 - B)dSt =  + (1 - (B))t,

(19)

where   R+0 . Rearranging, the LMACP type II is then defined as

St|Ft-1  P(t), t  Z,

t

=

(1

 - (B))

+

(B)St,

(20)

where  is the polynomial (14). For the LMACDP type II we correspondingly change the conditional distribution assumption to St|Ft-1  DP(t, ). The non-negativity of the conditional mean is guaranteed as long as the conditions of Proposition 1 are fulfilled (see Conrad and Haag (2006)).
The major difference to the type I specification is that the unconditional mean of the type II model is not finite since for d < 0.5 the coefficients of the power expansion of (1-B)-d for B = 1 are not summable. This result is analogous to the difference between FIGARCH processes and long memory GARCH specifications proposed by Karanasos

6Note that in the case 0.5  d  1 limk

15

et al. (2004). Hence, the expectation E[St] = E[(1) + (B)(1 - (B))t] = E[(1)] is not defined for (B) := (1 - (B))-1(1 - B)-d. The type II model is thus not covariance stationary and the long memory condition (1) cannot be directly verified since second moments do not exist. 7
However, computing impulse response functions we show that the model can still capture long range dependence. The impulse response function of the LMACDP type II is defined in terms of the sequence k, k = 0, 1, ..,

k

:=

 E[St+k |Ft ] t

-

E[St+k-1|Ft] . t

(21)

Then, the cumulative impulse response function is given by k :=

k l=0

l,

k

=

0,

1,

...,

where k can be derived from the first difference in St,

(1

(22)

with (B) :=

.

The impulse response weights can also be recovered from

the cumulative impulse responses by (B) = (1-B)(B), where (B) :=

 k=0

k

B

k

.

From (22) we deduce that (B) = (B). Thus, in the long run, shocks to the mean

die out because (1) = 0, i.e.,

k

lim

l

lim

k

l=0

(23)

The shocks exhibit a slow, hyperbolic decay rate dependent on the parameter d since k = k  Ckd-1 for high k. Since this behavior is present also for 0.5  d  1, we relax the restriction implied by the type I model and require 0 < d  1 in the type II specification.

7While Baillie et al. (1996) argue that the strict stationarity holds for FIGARCH models based on the results by Bougerol and Picard (1992), a similar argument does not hold for the LMACDP type II model as the conditional mean cannot be factored out from the Poisson distribution.

4 Forecasting Bid-Ask Spreads

4.1 Computation of Forecasts
We evaluate out-of-sample forecasts based on a rolling window setup where the underlying model is re-estimated every 10 minutes to quickly adapt to potential changes in parameters. In particular, we conduct the following steps for the Jan./Feb. 2008 sample:
(i) (Estimation) Estimate the econometric model based on an estimation window corresponding to five trading days of 30 second spread data.
(ii) (Forecasting) Using the parameter estimates from (i), derive successive one-step ahead forecasts for the 10 minute horizon ahead of the estimation window.
(iii) (Rolling forward the windows) Move estimation and forecast window forward 10 minutes.
The models are estimated based on truncations of the (infinite) power expansion of (1 - B)d. Pre-estimation analysis shows that a truncation point of 250 observations is sufficient to obtain reliable estimates which are widely independent of the truncation.
We evaluate point forecasts, St+1|t, and directional forecasts, Dt+1|t, defined as

St+1|t := t+1 , Dt+1|t := 1l {St+1|t>St} - 1l {St+1|t<St},

(24) (25)

where t+1 is the mean forecast for t + 1 based on the conditional mean specification and [·] rounds its argument to the nearest integer. Hence, Dt+1|t  {-1, 0, 1} if spreads increase, are constant and decrease, respectively.

4.2 Additional Predictors based on Market Microstructure Theory
Decomposing the bid-ask spread into its components, Glosten and Harris (1988), George et al. (1991), Huang and Stoll (1997) and Bollen et al. (2004), among others, identify adverse selection and order processing costs as the main factors driving the spread. The adverse selection component of spreads is highly related to the amount of information

17

asymmetry in the market. To capture states of high uncertainty and imbalances in

the market, we include the realized volatility, given as the sum of squared mid-quote

returns over each 30s interval and, alternatively, the absolute 30s mid-quote returns.

Moreover, we construct measures of relative trade imbalance and relative depth im-

balance to account for asymmetries in trading. The relative trade imbalance is given

as

| T imbt :=

tm  =t1

V

·

1l {q =-1} -

tm  =t1

tm  =t1

V

V

·

1l {q =1}| ,

(26)

where 1l {·} denotes the indicator function and V1, V2,...,Vm are the trade sizes corre-

sponding to the time points t1 to tm of a 30 second interval. The trade indicator qt

classifies trades into buys (+1) and sells (-1) according to the Lee and Ready (1991)

algorithm. The relative depth imbalance is defined as

DP imbt

:=

|Adpt Adpt

- +

Bdpt| , Bdpt

(27)

where Adpt denotes the best ask depth and Bdpt the best bid depth. As additional predictors we include the overall depth, given as the sum of the order book depth at best bid and ask level as well as the 30s cumulative trading volume serving as proxies for possible adverse selection in the market.
Finally, intraday periodicities in spreads are captured by a flexible Fourier form as proposed by Gallant (1981),

Q
s(t) = st¯+ (1s,j cos(t¯2j) + 2s,j sin(t¯2j)),
j=1

(28)

where s, 1s,j and 2s,j are parameters and t¯  [0, 1] is the normalized intraday time defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of a trading day until observation t, divided by the length of the trading day.
In addition to the static inclusion of covariates, we alternatively conduct the following adaptive selection of the covariates in each step to allow for possible structural changes (see Blaskowitz and Herwartz (2009) for a related setup):

(i) Estimate an AR model for spreads with all covariates based on observations within the estimation window. The AR setup is chosen here because (least squares) estimates can be computed in closed form which significantly reduces

18

the computation burden in the rolling window framework.
(ii) Discard predictors which are insignificant according to heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors and execute steps (i) to (iii) from the scheme in 4.1 using only the remaining relevant predictors.

4.3 Forecast Benchmarks
To benchmark our approach, we compute forecasts using the following competing models:
(i) A random walk model ("na¨ive" forecast) given by St = St-1 + t, where t is white noise.
(ii) An exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) given by

St+1 = 0St + 1St-1 + 2St-2 + · · · ,

(29)

where the weights are computed according to i = (1 - )i, 0 <  < 1 and the smoothing coefficient  is selected as the value minimizing the mean squared prediction error of one-step ahead forecasts.
(iii) An ARMA(p,q) model for St, defined by the equation

(1 - (B))(St - c) = (1 - (B))t, t  Z,

(30)

where  and  are lag polynomials as defined above and the errors t are assumed to be normally distributed.
Moreover, we consider the ARFIMA (p,d,q) model put forward by Granger and Joyeaux (1980), Granger (1981) and Hosking (1981), given by

(1 - (B))(1 - B)d(St - c) = (1 - (B))t, t  Z, c  R.

(31)

(iv) The autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model introduced by Engle and

Russell (1998) and Engle (2000), which is the workhorse to capture serially dependent

positive-valued random variables, given by St = µt · t for t  Z with conditional mean

µt,

µt =  + (B)St + (B)µt,  > 0.

(32)

19

The errors are assumed to be Weibull distributed, t|Ft-1  W(µt, ), with parameter .
Accordingly, the FIACD proposed by Jasiak (1998) is given by St = µt · t with t|Ft-1  W(µt, ) and

(1 - (B))(1 - L)dSt =  + (1 - (B))t,  > 0,

(33)

where (B) := (B) + (B) and t := St - µt is a martingale difference.

4.4 Point Forecast and Directional Forecast Evaluation

Let ti+1|t := Sti+1|t - Sti+1 be the forecast error of model i  {1, 2}. To assess the basic forecast performance we report the root mean squared error (RMSE) of a series

of forecast errors ti+1|t, t = 1, .., T . The predictive accuracy of competing forecast models, i = 1, 2, is tested using the test of Diebold and Mariano (1995) (DM), based

on the loss differential

dt :=

1t+1|t

2
-

2t+1|t

2
.

(34)

To test for differences in forecast performances, we test the null H0 : E[dt] = 0. In

the case of one-step ahead forecasts, the DM test statistic takes the form DM := d¯/ Var(d¯), where d¯ is the average of the dt.

A minor modification of the DM test is necessary if nested models are compared.

This is the case when we augment the models by additional predictors which inflate

the RMSE due to additional estimation errors. Clark and West (2007) propose a test

that explicitly accounts for the nested model structure. Let model 2 nest model 1 and

let

a¯ := 1 T T

St1+1|t - St2+1|t

2
.

t=1

(35)

A suitable test statistic of the null is then given by

CW :=

d¯- a¯ .

Var d¯- a¯

(36)

As the distribution of CW is non-standard, simulated critical values based on Clark and McCracken (2001) have to be used.

20

Note that Diebold-Mariano and Clark-West type tests can only compare two mod-
els. According to White (2000), a problem of such a sequential testing of competing
models is that standard p-values may become invalid because of a possible spurious
selection of the best model due to data snooping. Hansen (2005) proposes a test for
superior predictive accuracy (SPA) that can account for this problem. Let i = 1 denote
22
the benchmark model and let dti := 1t+1|t - it+1|t be the loss differential to the rival model i  {2, 3, .., m}. The null hypothesis of the SPA test is

H0 : E[dit]  0 i  {2, .., m}.

(37)

Hence, H0 is rejected whenever at least one of the competing models generates significantly better forecasts. The null can be tested based on the statistic

SP A := max max Var(d¯i)-1/2d¯i , 0 ,
i

(38)

where Var(d¯i) denotes the estimated variance of d¯i. The distribution of the SP A statistic has to be bootstrapped since the real distribution is nonstandard. Details of the stationary bootstrap procedure can be found in Hansen (2005).
In case of directional forecasts, the tests outlined above are straightforwardly applied based on the directional forecast errors t+1|t := Dt+1|t - Dt+1, where Dt+1 := 1l {St+1>St} - 1l {St+1<St} is the realized direction of the spread movement. In addition to the SPA, DM and Clark-West tests for the squared directional error series, we report the directional accuracy of the forecasts which is given as

DA := #{t : Dt+1 = Dt+1|t} . T

(39)

5 Results

5.1 Estimation Results and RMSE Performance
Model selection for all models is conducted by minimizing the RMSEs for one-step ahead forecasts of the January 2008 data. In this respect, we globally identify an ACP(1,1), ARMA(4,2), ACD(1,1) and Double ACP(1,1) as the best performing specifications across the stocks considered. To restrict the computational burden, the

21

fractionally integrated and long memory specifications are restricted to p = q = 1. Diagnostics in terms of Probability Integral Transforms (PIT) based on probability mass function forecasts and autocorrelation functions are given in the web appendix, http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~grosskla/index.html. The diagnostics show that the LMACDP type II yields the best model fit in terms of capturing the spread distribution and dynamics.

Table 3 gives the median parameter estimates of the Double ACDP and LMACDP type II models over all estimates of the rolling window setup. Figure 6 shows the evolution of estimates for the fractional integration parameter d of the LMACDP type II model. We observe that the persistence in bid-ask spread clearly varies over time which makes it necessary to allow for parameter changes in a rolling window setup. The evolution of the estimates of the additional regressor coefficients is given in Figures 8 to 13 in the appendix. The signs of the parameter estimates are in line with economic theory. While volatility and trading volume are positively related to bid-ask spreads, the effects of trade and depth imbalances fluctuate around zero. Moreover, depth coefficients are widely negative, reflecting that deep markets are accompanied by low spreads reflecting periods of high liquidity.
The upper panel of Table 4 gives the one-step ahead RMSEs and the directional accuracy for all models without additional predictors. We observe that a Poisson-based

Figure 6: Evolution of the estimates of the fractional integration parameter in the LMACDP type II. 95 % confidence intervals dotted

model always performs best with RMSEs on average 18 % lower than those of the random walk benchmark. Likewise, the directional accuracy of Poisson-based forecasts improves on average by 25 % over the na¨ive benchmark. Overall, the LMACDP type I and II models outperform FIACD and ARFIMA benchmarks in terms of the RMSE and DA, with differences in the forecast performance being especially high for the directional forecasts. These results indicate that an appropriate distribution as implied by the Double Poisson distribution yields efficiency gains which lead to superior predictions. Moreover, in most cases we find forecasts of LMACDP type II specifications to be (marginally) superior compared to type I specifications.
The lower panel of Table 4 shows the RMSE and DA for the LMACDP type II model augmented by covariates. It turns out that the inclusion of predictors improves both point and direction forecasts. However, including all predictors ("All Predictors") or adaptive selections thereof ("Preselected Pred.") do not necessarily provide better forecasts than including only single predictors. Hence, potential forecast gains by the inclusion of several variables are obviously offset by a higher estimation uncertainty.

Table 6: P-Values of the SPA test for all competing models. Highest value highlighted. Notation for the additional covariates as in Table 4

Table 5 shows Diebold-Mariano and Clark-West tests for forecast comparisons of the best and second best specifications in terms of the RMSE. It turns out that point and directional forecasts of models without predictors are significantly different from each other. Hence, the superior performance of LMACDP models in terms of the RMSE and DA shown in Table 4 is statistically significant. The Clark-West tests indicate that the inclusion of trading characteristics in LMACDP type II models yields a significant improvement of the forecasting power over the basic LMACDP type II. However, among specifications including covariates, differences between squared prediction errors are often insignificant according to the Diebold-Mariano Test. This reflects that most of the covariates carry similar information about the adverse selection costs driving spreads.
To identify the overall best performing model in terms of point and direction forecasts we present the results of the SPA test in Table 6. In three out of the four cases we cannot reject the null at the 10 % level that a LMACDP type II model including covariates provides the best forecast performance. The p-values are widely in accordance with the ordering of models according to the RMSE and DA results tabulated in Table 4.
We summarize the following main findings: First, the efficiency gains implied by (Double) Poisson modeling yield significantly superior forecast results in terms of the RMSE and DA criterion. Second, the forecast performance of the long memory specifications compared to their short-memory counterparts indicate the importance of accounting for the strong persistence in spreads. Third, the inclusion of predictors significantly improves point- and direction forecasts.
5.2 A Trading Schedule based on Spread Forecasts
To evaluate the potential economic gains implied by spread forecasts, we consider quantifying spread costs in trading schemes. The trading schedules are motivated by the fact that transaction costs of large trades can be reduced by splitting orders into smaller trades and are distributed over time. In such strategies, spread forecasts can improve trading algorithms by allowing to intensify trading in periods when spreads are expected to be small.
Suppose a benchmark trading schedule is based on trades occurring at the end

10 min

Figure 7: The principle of the trading schedule. 5s fc, 30s fc, 60s fc and 300s fc stand for the forecasts based on different data aggregation frequencies
of each 5 minute interval. In an alternative trading schedule the time of the trades is flexible within each interval and can be chosen in accordance with corresponding spread forecasts. Then, the resulting transaction costs serve as a measure of the implied economic gains.
To obtain a fine grid of spread forecasts within each 5 minute interval, we construct bid-ask spread forecasts on a 5, 30, 60 and 300 second frequency employing the LMACDP type II specification with seasonal component. Let f c5x, f c3x0, f c6x0 and f c300 denote spread forecasts on a 5, 30, 60 and 300 second data aggregation frequency, respectively. Moreover, let x  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} indicate the corresponding 1 minute subinterval withing the 5 minute interval. Then, the timing of trades in the flexible schedule is chosen as follows.
· Starting from the left interval boundary, we search in the x successive subintervals for the smallest forecast out of {f cx5, f c3x0, f c6x0, f c300} until we arrive at the right boundary or a minimum is found. Once a minimum is found for x  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we do not consider subintervals x > x since these are not known by a trader using one-step ahead forecasts on 5s, 30s, 60s and 300s frequencies. In case f c3x0 or f cx60 is a new optimum, we optimize the time of trading within the corresponding subinterval using the forecasts on higher frequencies. Figure 7 illustrates the procedure.
· In case of equal forecasts, min{f c5x, f cx30, f cx60}=f c300, we choose the timing of

Table 7: Spread cost savings as percentage of the benchmark schedule when employing forecasts in the schedules. Schedule names refer to the three rules in case of equal forecasts

trades according to one of the following three options.
(i) Motivated by traders' tendency to trade as fast as possible, we choose the time of trading to be closest to the left boundary of the interval and stop searching for further minima. The resulting schedule is labelled "fast".
(ii) We choose the time of trading to be closest to the right boundary and successively optimize the time of trading using forecasts on higher frequencies until the time of the new minimum forecast. The resulting schedule is labelled "slow".
(iii) We use the information from the probability mass function and weight the equal forecasts with the assigned forecasted probabilities f (St+1|t, t+1, ), where f denotes the Double Poisson probability mass function. Then, we choose the most probable forecast to be the new optimal one and optimize the trading in the subintervals until we arrive at another optimum. This schedule is labelled "PMF info".
After the timing of trades is chosen we sum up the incurred transaction costs (induced by crossings of the market) for the benchmark strategy and the three alternative schedules. Table 7 reports the percentage spread cost savings over the benchmark strategy. We find that the strategy exploiting the information from the pmfs of the Double Poisson assumption yields the highest average gains: spread costs reduce by 11.46% of the costs of the benchmark schedule. The "slow" schedule saves us 11.26% and the "fast" strategy still 8.74%. The better performance of the strategies "slow" and "PMF info" is obviously induced by the use of more optimization steps due to the rule specification in case of equal forecasts.

5.3 Robustness of the Results
Several robustness checks underscore the relevance of our study. First, we can confirm the reported RMSE results for a larger cross-section of stocks from the mid-cap segment of the Russell 3000. Our web appendix http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~grosskla/ index.html shows descriptive statistics, point forecast and trading schedule evaluations for 46 stocks ordered according to their average spread. We find that the RMSE improvement of the LMACDP type II over the na¨ive benchmark model is 19.51% on average across stocks with average spread ticks  (2, 4) and 18.90% for stocks with mean spread ticks greater than 4. Interestingly, forecast gains are also possible in case of nearly constant stocks: RMSE improvements over the na¨ive model are on average 13.55% for stocks with mean spread ticks < 2.
Second, the spread cost savings from the trading schedules tend to increase with the size of average spreads. Moreover, the specification of a flexible probability mass function in the Poisson models becomes more and more important with increasing spread sizes. While the "PMF info" trading schedule does not generate higher percentage cost savings than the alternative two schedules for stocks with spreads smaller than 4 ticks, the opposite is true when average spreads become larger than 4 ticks. We conclude that the flexible Double Poisson modelling is the more useful the larger the spreads and the more dispersed the spread series.
Third, the results are not only relevant for quoted spreads but also for alternative spread measures like, e.g., effective spreads. Effective spreads are closely related to quoted spreads (see Figure 1) and reveal very similar time series properties.
6 Conclusions
Motivated by the relevance of bid-ask spreads in trading decisions and market microstructure modelling this study is the first one systematically analyzing forecasts of quoted bid-ask spreads. To capture the empirical features of spread time series for Russell 3000 mid cap stocks traded at NYSE and NASDAQ we introduce a novel long memory autoregressive conditional Poisson (LMACP) model. The LMACP can accomodate highly persistent time series of count data and is thus suitable for modeling persistent discrete time series which are often found in high-frequency data applica-
30

tions. We find that autoregressive conditional Poisson (ACP) models and their long mem-
ory extension well capture the distributional and dynamic properties of quoted bid-ask spreads. Generallizations of the Poisson distribution, such as the Double Poisson distribution, are able to account for both under- and overdispersion found in the data and underscore the good fit of the proposed model. Forecasting bid-ask spreads in a rolling window out-of-sample framework shows that long memory ACP models outperform competing benchmarks like ARFIMA, ARMA, ACD, FIACD and exponential moving average models in terms of the root mean squared error, directional accuracy and density forecasts. Implementing the spread forecasts in a simple trading algorithm we find that spread forecast can induce transaction cost savings of up to 12%.

Proof. We obtain an expression for the unconditional variance of the errors t of the Double Poisson specification from the following steps. We have

E[t2] = E[(St - t)2] = E[St2] - 2E[E[Stt|Ft-1]] + E[2t ] = E[St2] - E[t2],
since t depends only on past values of t and St, and
