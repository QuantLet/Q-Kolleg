Can the New Keynesian Phillips Curve Explain Ination Gap Persistence?
Fang Yao Humboldt Universität zu Berlin
May 27, 2010
Abstract Whelan (2007) found that the generalized Calvo-sticky-price model fails to replicate a typical feature of the empirical reduced-form Phillips curve -- the positive dependence of ination on its own lags. In this paper, I show that it is the 4-period-Taylor-contract hazard function he chose that gives rise to this result. In contrast, an empirically-based aggregate price reset hazard function can generate simulated data that are consistent with ination gap persistence found in US CPI data. I conclude that a non-constant price reset hazard plays a crucial role for generating realistic ination dynamics.

1 Introduction
The nature of ination persistence is a complex phenomenon, because it is inuenced by many aspects of the economy. For example, Cogley and Sbordone (2008) argue that it is important to distinguish between the ination trend persistence and the ination gap persistence, since they arise from di¤erent economic sources. While dynamics of trend ination results largely from shifts in the long-run target of the monetary policy rule, ination gap persistence is inuenced primarily by the pricing behavior at the ...rm's level and the price aggregation mechanism.
The focus of this paper is the dynamics of the ination gap -- the di¤erence between the actual ination and trend ination. I ...rst document some stylized facts distinguishing ination gap persistence from ination level persistence. I ...nd evidence from the U.S. CPI data that the ination gap constitutes a large part of ination persistence. Second, I investigate whether the stylized fact can be explained by the theoretical New Keynesian Phillips curve ( hereafter: NKPC), and further identify which mechanism of the model is most important for generating ination gap persistence.
The purely forward-looking NKPC is often criticized for generating too little ination persistence (See: e.g. Fuhrer and Moore, 1995). To overcome this weakness, various generalizations of the basic NKPC have been developed in the literature, they o¤er, however, di¤erent interpretations on the nature of ination gap persistence. The hybrid NKPC incorporates lagged ination into the standard NKPC motivated by the positive backward-dependence of ination in the empirical reduced-form Phillips curve1. According to this line of literature, ination gap persistence should be interpreted as `intrinsic'(Fuhrer, 2006) and the dependency between current and lagged ination should be treated as a ...xed primitive relationship, which is independent of monetary policy. By contrast, the more micro-founded general-pricing-hazard models2 shed new lights on the important role played by inertia of expectations in generating ination gap persistence. According to this class of models, ination gap persistence is inherited. It comes from the additional moving-average terms of real driving forces through the lagged expectations. More importantly, since the coe¢ cient on lagged ination depends on the whole model including the speci...cation of monetary policy, it implies that the hybrid NKPC should be subject to the Lucas critique (Lucas, 1972), and thereby can not be used in the monetary policy analysis.
Despite the theoretical solidity of the general-pricing-hazard model, Whelan (2007) rejected it empirically. He showed that the general-pricing-hazard model fails to replicate the positive backward-dependence of ination typically found in the empirical reduced-form Phillips curve. In partial equilibrium,Whelan proved that the coe¢ cient on the lagged ination is always negative, regardless of the form of the price reset hazard function. Furthermore, he used a simple DSGE model to show that, even in general equilibrium, this model still generates negative coe¢ cients on ination lags.
In this paper, I ...rst replicate his ...ndings and check their robustness to alternative setups of the model. In particular, I test the result using di¤erent price reset hazard functions, aggregate demand conditions and monetary policy rules. I ...nd that it is the 4-period-Taylor-contract hazard function used in the Whelan's setup that gave rise to the result. Under an empirically based pricing hazard function estimated by Yao (2010), the simulated data accounts quite well

for the ination gap persistence I ...nd in the U.S. CPI data after the Volcker disination period. The reason why the hazard function greatly a¤ects ination gap persistence is that backwarddependence of ination in the model is determined by two counteracting channels. The "frontloading channel" always weakens ination gap persistence, because lagged ination enters the NKPC with negative coe¢ cients, magnitudes of which are purely determined by the price reset hazard function. By contrast, the second channel works through the expectational terms in the NKPC. In this channel, lagged inations have positive coe¢ cients when lagged inations act as leading indicator of other variables. As a result, the magnitude of the "expectation channel" is not only a¤ected by the price reset hazard function, but also by the other general equilibrium forces, such as aggregate demand side of the economy and monetary policy. Overall, ination gap persistence in this framework results from a more complex propagation mechanism, in which the price reset hazard function exerts crucial e¤ects through various channels.
The general-pricing-hazard models have been studied in the macro literature to understand consequences of di¤erent price reset hazard functions for macro dynamics. It is important, because, in recent years, empirical studies using detailed micro-level price data sets3 generally reach the consensus that, instead of having economy-wide uniform price stickiness, the frequency of price adjustments di¤ers substantially across sections. This new evidence issues a serious challenge to the Calvo pricing assumption (Calvo, 1983). In addition, micro empirical evidence largely rejects the constant hazard function, implied by the Calvo model (See, e.g.: Cecchetti, 1986, Alvarez, 2007 and Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008). In response to this challenge, theoretical work by Wolman (1999) raised the issue that ination dynamics should be sensitive to the hazard function underlying di¤erent pricing rules. He showed this result in a partial equilibrium analysis. Kiley (2002) compared the Calvo and Taylor staggered-pricing models and showed the dynamics of output following monetary shocks are both quantitatively and qualitatively di¤erent across the two pricing speci...cations unless one assumes a substantial level of real rigidity in the economy. Carvalho (2006) constructed a sticky price model that allows for heterogeneous Calvo-sticky-price sectors. He found that existence of heterogeneity in price stickiness generates large and persistent real e¤ects of monetary policy, which can be replicated by a constant-hazard-pricing model only when it is calibrated with an unrealistic low frequency of price adjustments. Sheedy (2007) derived the generalized NKPC under a recursive formulation of the hazard function and showed that, under this parameterization, the dependence of current and lagged ination is determined by the slope of the hazard function. This result, however, is not applicable in more general cases. Whelan (2007) derived the NKPC under a general hazard function and showed that backward-dependence of ination in this structural Phillips curve is mostly negative. Based on this ...nding he drew the conclusion that this class of models can not explain the observation from the reduced-form Phillips curve regression that ination is positively dependent on its lags.
It is noteworthy that non-zero trend ination is also important for the short-run ination dynamics(See: Ascari, 2004). Furthermore, Cogley and Sbordone (2008) extend the Calvo NKPC by allowing for time-drifting trend ination and they show that changing trend ination a¤ects coe¢ cients of the NKPC and hence the short-run ination dynamics. Even though the general-hazard NKPC does not incorporate this feature, this limitation does not prohibit the

general-price-hazard model from standing as a useful analytical tool for ination dynamics. Empirical evidence shows that, while non-constant hazard function is a robust feature of the pricing behavior in the data, the time-varying trend ination is not always equally important all the time. During the oil crises in the 1970's, volatile ination trend maybe predominated ination dynamics, but, after early 1980's, U.S. trend ination became moderate and stable in the data. These two versions of the generalized NKPC complement each other, combining them, however, gives an interesting perspective for future work.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 documents stylized fact of ination gap persistence in the U.S. data. In section 2, I present the model with the generalized time-dependent pricing and derive the New Keynesian Phillips curve; section 3 shows analytical results regarding new insights gained from relaxing the constant hazard function underlying the Calvo assumption and implications for ination gap persistence is also discussed; in section 4, I simulate the DSGE model with di¤erent setups and identify the most important feature in generating ination gap persistence; section 5 contains some concluding remarks.
2 Ination Persistence in the Data
Whelan (2007) has documented that U.S. ination in the post-WWII periods is highly persistent when measured by the sum of autocorrelation coe¢ cients of ination level and the coe¢ cient of lagged ination in the reduced-form Phillips curve. Based on this evidence, he rejected the general-pricing hazard model as a valid model for ination dynamics. However, it is important to distinguish the ination gap persistence from the ination trend persistence, because sticky price models are really designed to explain the short-run dynamics of ination gap which are caused by the collective pricing behavior of ...rms in the economy, instead of the dynamics of trend ination which are mainly determined by the central bank's monetary policy targets.
Recently, there are a growing number of studies on ination persistence controlling a drifting trend ination. Levin and Piger (2003), Altissimo et al. (2006), Cogley and Sbordone (2008) and Cogley et al. (2008) document using both U.S. and European data that, when correctly accounting for the time-varing trend ination, various measures of ination gap persistence fall signi...cantly. Here I present evidence on ination gap persistence using the U.S. CPI data. In addition, I report results controlling di¤erent measures for trend ination.
I estimate two measures of ination persistence using the U.S. time series data from 1960 Q1 to 2007 Q44. First, following Andrews and Chen (1992), I calculate the sum of AR coe¢ cients
4 I download data from the database FRED maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. I calculate the ination rate by using the Consumer Price Index data for all urban consumers: all items and seasonally adjusted (Series: CPIAUCSL). The monthly data is ...rst converted into quarterly frequency by arithmetic averaging and then the annualized Ination rate is de...ned as 400 ln (Pt=Pt 1) : Furthermore, to measure the real inationary pressures, I ...rst construct data of real output gap per capita, which is based on the Real GDP (Series: GDPC1). They are in the unit of billions of chained 2005 dollars, quarterly frequency and seasonally adjusted. To calculate real GDP per capita, I use the Civilian Noninstitutional Population (Series: CNP16OV) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The monthly data in the unit of thousands is ...rst converted into quarterly frequency by arithmetic averaging. The real GDP per capita is de...ned as: ln (GDPt 1; 000; 000=P OPt) : Finally real output gap per capita is obtained by detrending the data by the Hodrick-Prescott ...lter. In addition, I download the unit labor share for non-farm business sector (Series: PRS85006173) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as a measure of real marginal cost.

To construct ination gap, we need to ...rst calculate measures of the ination trend. Since

there is no standard way to do it in the literature, I ...rst choose a naive method to detrend

ination by the Hodrick-Prescott (H-P) ...lter. The biggest limitation of this method, however,

is that the H-P ...lter is only based on the univariate process. As argued by Cogley and Sbordone

(2008), when the trend ination is nonzero and drifting over time, it should also depend on other

real variables, such as the trend of real marginal cost. To account for this feature of the data,

they proposed to estimate a VAR model with drifting parameters and stochastic volatility for

four variables - output growth rate, the log of unit labor cost, ination and the nominal discount

factor. After that, they calculate an approximation of trend ination by de...ning it as the level to

which ination expectation settles in the long run. Following the same methodology, I construct CPI ination trend for the periods between 1960 Q1 to 2007 Q46.

In Figure (1), I plot the two measures of trend ination. In the left panel, we observe that

the two trends di¤er substantially. While the H-P trend (dashed line) follows closely to actual

ination, the Cogley-Sbordone trend (hereafter: C-S trend) is much more moderate. The median

estimate of trend ination rose by roughly 1% at the annual rate during 1970's and fell back

to around 1.3% in the early 80's, then stayed relative stable until 2007. On the right panel, I

compare the two trends more closely. As portrayed by the two dash lines, the 90% con...dent interval of estimated C-S ination trend is quite wide, especially during the volatile periods in 1970's. It indicates a great deal of uncertainty about trend ination associating with the C-S method. Even through the H-P trend is substantially di¤erent to the C-S trend, it lies within the con...dent interval for the most of sample periods. Due to this reason, in Table (1), I report measures of ination gap persistence for both H-P and C-S trend ination.

Table 1: Empirical Results based on the Ination Data

The ...rst row of the table indicates which de...nition of ination is used to calculate the measures of persistence. I report results for ination level, ination gap detrended by the H-P ...lter and ination gap detrended by the Cogley and Sbordone method. Under each label, three measures of ination persistence are presented, i.e. the sum of autocorrelation coe¢ cients AR, the coe¢ cient of lagged ination in the reduced-form Phillips curve when the real driving force is measured by H-P detrended real output per capita (y^), and the coe¢ cient of lagged ination in the reduced-form Phillips curve when the real driving force is measured by the unit labor share (LS). The ...rst noteworthy result from the table is that the CPI ination was indeed highly persistent over the subsample from 1960 to 1985. It fell dramatically, however, after the Volcker disination of 1980's. This ...nding is consistent with what is found in the literature. Second, the magnitude of ination gap persistence crucially depends on the measure of trend ination. When the H-P trend is used, ination gap persistence is signi...cantly lower than that in the ination level. It becomes even insigni...cant from zero during the second subsample. By contrast, when the C-S trend is used, ination gap persistence is lower, but much closer to the measured ination level persistence. It is instructive to compare the C-S trend with two extreme cases of ination detrending, namely the linear detrending and the detrending by the H-P ...lter. While the mean detrending does not change the ination persistence at all, the H-P detrending reduces it to the greatest extent. The multivariable-based C-S method gives values between these two extreme cases. Even through it is not very accurate, one can still draw conclusion from this evidence that the true ination gap persistence is signi...cant and positive and ination gap persistence constitutes a large part of ination persistence. In the later section, I will use the C-S measure of ination gap persistence as the benchmark for evaluating the performance of the theoretical model.
In the light of these results, we can sum up some stylized facts of ination gap persistence. 1. Ination gap persistence constitutes a large part of ination persistence in the U.S. CPI data. 2. CPI ination gap is highly persistent during periods between 1960 to 1985. The sum of coe¢ cients on lagged ination lies in the range around 0:85 with the standard deviation of 0:06.

3. ination gap persistence reduces signi...cantly after the Volcker disination period. The sum of coe¢ cients on lagged ination reduces to around 0:37 with the standard deviation of 0:16.

3 The Model
In this section, I use a DSGE model to analyze the persistence of ination gap found in the U.S. data. The main feature of the model is the incorporation of a general price reset hazard function into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model. A hazard function of price setting is de...ned as the probabilities of price adjustment conditional on the spell of time elapsed since the last price change. In this model, the hazard function is a discrete function taking values between zero and one on its time domain.

3.1 Representative Household

A representative, in...nitely-lived household derives utility from the composite consumption good

Ct, and its labor supply Lt, and it maximizes a discounted sum of utility of the form:

3.2 Firms in the Economy

3.2.1 Real Marginal Cost

The production side of the economy is composed of a continuum of monopolistic competitive

...rms, each producing one variety of product i by using labor. Each ...rm maximizes real pro...ts,

subject to the production function

Yt(i) = ZtLt(i)

(8)

where Zt denotes an aggregate productivity shock. Log deviations of the shock, z^t; follow an exogenous AR(1) process z^t = zz^t 1 + "z;t, and "z;t is white noise with z 2 [0; 1). Lt(i) is the demand of labor by ...rm i.

Following equation (3), demand for intermediate goods is given by

Yt(i) =

Pt(i) Pt

Yt:

(9)

In each period, ...rms choose optimal demands for labor inputs to maximize their real pro...ts

given nominal wage, market demand (9) and the production technology (8):

And real marginal cost can be derived from this maximization problem

Furthermore, using the production function (8), output demand equation (9), the labor supply

condition (6) and the fact that at the equilibrium Ct = Yt, I can express real marginal cost only

in terms of aggregate output and technology shock.

mct = Yt + Zt (1+ ):

(11)

3.2.2 Pricing Decisions under Nominal Rigidity
In this section, I introduce a general form of nominal rigidity, which is characterized by a set of hazard rates depending on the spell of the time since last price adjustment. I assume that monopolistic competitive ...rms cannot adjust their price whenever they want. Instead, opportunities for re-optimizing prices are dictated by the hazard rates, hj, where j denotes the time-since-last-adjustment and j 2 f0; Jg. J is the maximum number of periods in which a ...rm's price can be ...xed.

Dynamics of the Price-duration Distribution In the economy, ...rms' prices are heterogeneous with respect to the time since their last price adjustment. Table 2 summarizes key notations concerning the dynamics of the price-duration distribution.

Using the notation de...ned in Table 2, and also denoting the distribution of price durations

(12)

Firms reoptimizing their prices in period t are labeled with `Duration 0', and the proportion of those ...rms is given by hazard rates of all duration groups multiplied by their corresponding densities. The ...rms left in each duration group are the ...rms that do not adjust their prices. When the period t is over, this ex-post distribution, ~ t; becomes the ex-ante distribution for the new period, t+1: All price duration groups move to the next one, because all prices age by one period.
As long as the hazard rates lie between zero and one, dynamics of the price-duration distribution can be viewed as a Markov process with an invariant distribution, , and is obtained by solving t(j) = t+1(j): It yields the stationary price-duration distribution (j):

(j) = Sj , for j = 0; 1 J 1:

I assume the economy converges to this invariant distribution fairly quickly, so that regard-

less of the initial price-duration distribution, I only consider the economy with the invariant

distribution of price durations. This assumption makes aggregation problem of the economy

tractable.

The Optimal Pricing under the General Form of Nominal Rigidity Given the general form of nominal rigidity introduced above, the only heterogeneity among ...rms is the time when they last reset their prices, j. Firms in price duration group j share the same probability of adjusting their prices, hj, and the distribution of ...rms across durations is given by (j).
In a given period when a ...rm is allowed to reoptimize its price, the optimal price chosen should reect the possibility that it will not be re-adjusted in the near future. Consequently, adjusting ...rms choose optimal prices that maximize the discounted sum of real pro...ts over the time horizon in which the new price is expected to be ...xed. The probability that a new price will be ...xed at least for j periods is given by the survival function, Sj, de...ned in Table 2.
I setup the maximization problem of an adjuster as follows:

JP1 max Et Sj Qt;t+j
Pt j=0

Ytd+jjt

Pt Pt+j

T Ct+j : Pt+j

Where Et denotes the conditional expectation based on the information set in period t, and Qt;t+j is the stochastic discount factor appropriate for discounting real pro...ts from t to t + j. An adjusting ...rm maximizes the pro...ts subject to the demand for its intermediate good in period t + j given that the ...rm resets the price in period t and can be expressed as.

Ytd+jjt =

Pt Pt+j

Yt+j :

This yields the following ...rst order necessary condition for the optimal price:

Pt =

JP1 Sj Et[Qt;t+j Yt+j Pt+j1M Ct+j ]

where M Ct denotes the nominal marginal cost. The optimal price is equal to the markup multiplied by a weighted sum of future marginal costs, whose weights depend on the survival rates. In the Calvo case, where Sj = j, this equation reduces to the Calvo optimal pricing condition.
Finally, given the stationary distribution, (j), aggregate price can be written as a distributed
sum of all optimal prices. I de...ne the optimal price which was set j periods ago as Pt j. Following the aggregate price index from equation (4), the aggregate price is then obtained by:

4.1 Economic Intuition
The general-hazard NKPC di¤ers from the standard NKPC in two aspects. First, the generalhazard NKPC has not only current and forward-looking terms but also lagged variables and lagged expectations. In addition, all coe¢ cients in the new NKPC are nonlinear functions of price reset hazard rates ( j = 1 hj) and the subjective discount factor : Thereby, short-run dynamics of ination gap are a¤ected by both the shape and magnitude of the price reset hazard function. To see the dynamic structure more clearly, I write down a simple example of the NKPC with J = 3.
7 The detailed derivation of the NKPC can be found in the technical Appendix (A).

Even though, from the ...rst glance, the general-hazard NKPC di¤ers substantially from the Calvo NKPC, they share the same economic intuition. In fact, should the hazard function be constant over the in...nite horizon, the general-hazard NKPC (18) reduces to the standard Calvo NKPC8 :

(1 )(1 ^t =

) mct + Et ^t+1

(20)

The general-hazard NKPC nests the Calvo NKPC in the sense that, under a constant hazard function, lagged ination terms exactly cancel lagged expectations, leaving only current variables and forward-looking expectations of ination in the expression.
To understand the economic intuition of the general-hazard NKPC, we need to categorize its dynamic components and exam the e¤ect of each component on ination. The general-hazard NKPC can be decomposed into three parts: 1) all forward-looking and current terms, 2) Lagged expectations and 3) lagged inations. In the following analysis, I represent these three parts with short-hand symbols Et(:), Et j(:) and ^t k respectively and Wx(hj) denotes coe¢ cients of those terms. Furthermore, by de...nition, ination is equal to the log di¤erence between two consecutive aggregate prices and the aggregate price in the period t can be further written as the distributed sum of current and past optimal reset prices. As illustrated in the following expressions (21), these three dynamic components of the general-hazard NKPC a¤ect ination through current reset price, past reset prices and past aggregate price respectively.

(21)

The economic reasons why those three components should show up in the general-hazard NKPC is that: ...rst, the current and forward-looking terms - Et(:) - enter the Phillips curve through their inuence on the current reset price. As same as in the Calvo sticky price model, the price setting in this model is forward-looking. The optimal price decision is based on the sum of current and future real marginal costs over the time span the reset price is ...xed. The only di¤erence now is that the time horizon of the pricing decision is not in...nite, but depends on the hazard function. Second, due to price stickiness, some fraction of past reset prices continue to a¤ect the current aggregate price. Lagged expectational terms -Et j(:)- represent inuences of past reset prices on current ination. Last, past inations enter the NKPC, because they a¤ect the lagged aggregate price p^t 1: The higher the past inations prevail, higher the lagged aggregate price would be, and thereby it deters current ination to be high.
The new insights gained from this analysis is that the two new dynamic components have opposing e¤ects on ination through p^t and p^t 1 respectively. The magnitudes of these e¤ects depend on the price reset hazard function. In the general case, they should be di¤erent to each other. Conversely, in the Calvo case, the constant hazard function leads reset prices to exert the exactly same amount of impact on both p^t and p^t 1, and thereby causes lagged expectations and lagged ination to be cancelled out.
This cancellation can be also seen in the derivation of the Calvo NKPC:

p^t = (1
= (1 = (1
p^t = (1 ... (1

}

)(1 ) mcct + Et(^t+1):

The crucial substitution from line (3) to line (4) is only possible, when the distribution of price durations takes the form of a power function. In conclusion, we learn that, lagged ination and lagged expectations are not extrinsic to the time-dependent sticky price model. They are missing in the Calvo setup only because of the restrictive constant-hazard assumption.

4.2 Implications for ination gap persistence
The purely forward-looking NKPC is often criticized for generating too little ination gap persistence(See: e.g. Fuhrer and Moore, 1995). In response to this challenge, the hybrid NKPC has been developed to capture the positive dependence of ination on its lags (See:e.g. Gali and Gertler, 1999 and Christiano et al., 2005). According to this strand of the literature, ination persistence should be interpreted as `intrinsic'and the dependency between current and lagged ination is mechanically modeled as a ...xed primitive relationship, which is independent of changes in monetary policy. By contrast, the generalized Calvo sticky price model, such as the one introduced in the previous section, captures this backward-dependency of ination in a

13

more micro-founded way. Unlike the hybrid models, ination gap persistence in this framework is the result of two counteracting channels. The ...rst channel gives lagged ination a direct role, which works through the past aggregate price. I call it the "front-loading channel" because it weakens ination gap persistence, and its magnitude is purely determined by the price reset hazard function. By contrast, the second channel is an indirect one, where lagged ination a¤ects current ination only through the expectational terms in the NKPC, I name it the "expectation channel". In this channel, lagged inations have positive coe¢ cients when lagged inations act as the leading indicator of other variables. Because, in the general equilibrium, the expectation formulation is determined by the whole setup of the model, the magnitude of the "expectation channel" is not only a¤ected by the price reset hazard function, but also by the other general equilibrium forces, such as aggregate demand side of the economy and monetary policy.

In the light of these results, the general-hazard NKPC preserves the implication of the standard Calvo NKPC for ination gap persistence, which is in stark contrast to those from the hybrid NKPC. First of all, ination gap persistence can not be interpreted as `intrinsic'. Instead, more persistence come from the additional moving-average terms of real driving forces introduced by the expectations. The positive coe¢ cient on lagged ination in the reduced-form Phillips curve results from the correlation between lagged ination and other variables in the general equilibrium, and therefore it is not a real economic behavioral relation, but a "statistical illusion". More importantly, since the coe¢ cient on lagged ination depends on the whole model, changes in any part of the general equilibrium setup ultimately a¤ects its value. Consequently, hybrid sticky price models are subject to the Lucas critique, and thereby can not be used in the monetary policy analysis.
Overall, ination gap persistence in this framework is the result of these two counteracting channels. Whelan (2007) has proved that, in the partial equilibrium setting, the net e¤ect of these two opposing forces is always negative, regardless of the form of the hazard function. He further showed that, even in the general equilibrium, the general-hazard sticky price model fails to replicate the positive backward-dependence of ination. My numerical analysis reveals, however, that it is the 4-period-Taylor-contract hazard function that gave rise to this result. When I use an empirically based hazard function, the simulated data can account well for the ination gap persistence I ...nd in the U.S. aggregate data after the Volcker disination period.

4.3 The General Equilibrium Analysis
In this section, I study the behavior of ination dynamics in the general equilibrium setup. For this purpose, I close the model by adding the aggregate demand side of the economy and a monetary policy rule. The log-linearized equilibrium equations are summarized in the following table:

The weights (W1; W2; W3; W4) in the general-hazard NKPC are de...ned in the equation (18). m^ t is the real money balance, and gt denotes the growth rate of the nominal money stock. The aggregate demand block is motivated either by the standard household intertemporal optimization problem outlined in the model section or by the quantity theory of money9. The monetary policy is speci...ed in terms of either a nominal money growth rule or a simple Taylor rule.

4.3.1 Calibration
In the calibration of the general equilibrium model, I choose some common values for the standard structural parameters. For the preference parameters, I assume = 0:9902, which implies a steady state real return on ...nancial assets of about four percent per annum. I also assume the intertemporal elasticity of substitution = 1, implying log utility of consumption. The Frisch elasticity of the labor supply is set to be 0:5, a value that is motivated by using balanced-growthpath considerations in the macro literature. In addition, I choose the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods = 10, which implies the desired markup over marginal cost should be about 11%.
Since the main purpose of the paper is to study the impact of the hazard function on ination gap persistence, I calibrate the hazard function as follows: My ...rst hazard function takes the
9 In this case, model has not enough structure to pin down the relationship between real marginal cost and output gap. To make the results quantitatively comparable, I assume, in this case, that real marginal cost holds the same relationship to output gap as in the complete model mcct = ( + ) y^t (1 + ) z^t:

Alternatively, I refer to the empirical ...nding by Yao (2010), who estimates the aggregate hazard function using the same framework and the same aggregate data set applied in this paper. As seen in the table (3) and the ...gure (2), the empirical hazard function di¤ers sharply to the theoretical hazard function. Overall, the aggregate hazard function is ...rst decreasing and then increases slowly with the age of the price. In comparison to the Taylor hazard function, where ...rms only adjust their prices after 4 quarters, the empirical hazard function highlights two important frequencies of the price adjustment. Additional to the yearly frequency, it is also evidence of a large exible price setting sector in the economy.

Table 3: Hazard Function Calibration
Proceeding with monetary policy parameters, the responses of nominal interest rate to ination and output gap ( and y) are chosen at the values commonly associated with the simple Taylor rule. Following Taylor (1993), I set to be 1.5, and the response coe¢ cient to output gap y to be 0.5. Finally, I set the standard deviation of the innovation to monetary policy shock to be 25 basic points per quarter.

4.3.2 Numerical Results
To evaluate the quantitative implications of the hazard function for ination gap persistence, I simulate di¤erent setups of the general-pricing-hazard model, then estimate the reduced-form Phillips curve using the arti...cial data. The reduced-form Phillips curve is speci...ed in the

I include both output gap and real marginal cost into the reduced-form Phillips curve, because in the theoretical model real marginal cost is the driving force of ination and output gap also a¤ect the ination dynamics through the monetary feedback rules.

Table 4: Simulation based Empirical Results

In Table (4), I report the sum of AR coe¢ cients of lagged inations ( ) generated by the simulated data of di¤erent theoretical setups. The ...rst three rows are models applying the 4-period-Taylor-contract hazard function. All these models produce negative coe¢ cient on ination lag, implying no ination persistence. The benchmark case (Model 1) has the same setup as in Whelan (2007), combining 4-period-Taylor-contract hazard function with the nominal money growth rule and simple aggregate demand equation. In this model, the reduced-form lagged ination coe¢ cient is negative (-0.538). Model 2 replaces the simple aggregate demand equation with the intertemporal IS curve derived from the household problem. This setup generates a even more negative coe¢ cient on ination lag than Model 1. In Model 3, I replace the money growth rule with the simple Taylor rule for monetary policy. ination gap persistence in this case becomes a little stronger than that in Model 2. By contrast, setups using the empirical hazard function (Model 4 to 7) generate realistic ination gap persistence as we observe in the data from 1986 to 2007. This comparison reveals that it is the unrealistic hazard function that drives the result that leads Whelan to reject the general-pricing-hazard model. From the analysis in the previous section, we know that the hazard function has direct inuence on both propagation channels in the general-hazard NKPC. When the magnitude of the second channel is large enough to compensate the negative coe¢ cients introduced by the ...rst channel, the reduced-form Phillips curve reveals a positive backward-dependence of ination. From the numerical results, it turns out that the hazard function is the most important factor in the complex propagation mechanism of ination dynamics.
Moreover, other parts of the general equilibrium model plays also a role in determining the magnitude of ination gap persistence. In contrast to the hazard function, this general equilibrium inuence mainly occurs through the expectation channel. Similar to the pattern revealed by the model 1 2 and 3, Model 4, 5, 6 conduct the same numerical experiments under the

17

empirically based hazard function. In the model 4, the reduced-form lagged ination coe¢ cient is positive (0.286). Model 5 replaces the simple demand equation with the IS curve and generates a slightly less ination gap persistence than Model 4. The reason why ination becomes even less persistent is that, with the intertemporal optimizing IS curve, demand shocks are not propagated completely to output gap and ination dynamics, but they are partially dampened by the rise of real interest rate. So that expectational channel becomes less powerful than the previous case. In Model 6, I replace the money growth rule with the simple Taylor rule. ination gap persistence in this case becomes a little stronger than that in Model 4. The Taylor rule changes ination gap persistence, because it introduces an extra channel, through which ination and real forces feedback to the economy, so that the expectation channel is strengthened. In addition, in Model 7, I apply another Taylor rule with a stronger ination response parameter and a zero response parameter to output gap. Shutting down the feedback of output gap to the interest rate rule makes the Taylor rule less powerful, so that it performs similar to the money growth rule.
In conclusion, both monetary policy rule and demand side of economy are important in propagating ination dynamics, but the fundamentally important factor in this mechanism is the hazard function. Using the empirically based hazard function along with the Taylor rule and IS curve (Model 6), the general-pricing-hazard model preforms best in replicating the stylized fact of ination gap persistence found in the U.S. CPI data from 1986 to 2007. It is not a surprising result, because most macroeconomists agree that monetary policy is well approximated by the simple Taylor rule with coe¢ cients conforming to the Taylor principle during this period of time. In addition, this time span is also characterized by low and stable trend ination. This character of data validates the use of the general-pricing-hazard model.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, I investigate whether the general-hazard NKPC is capable of accounting for the ination gap persistence. In the empirical part, I ...nd that, after detrending ination by the Cogley-Sbordone method, ination gap persistence is still signi...cant and large in the U.S. CPI data. In the theoretical part, I redo the general equilibrium analysis by Whelan (2007), and check robustness of the result to di¤erent setups of the model. I ...nd that the general-pricing-hazard model with empirically based price reset hazard function can account quite will for ination gap persistence found in the data of post Volcker's disination periods. The key mechanism at work in this model is the expectational channel in the generalized NKPC, which depends on the setup of the whole model, therefore ination gap persistence is also not independent of monetary policy. This result directly implies that the hybrid sticky price model should be subject to the Lucas critique, and thereby can not be used in the monetary policy analysis.
However, one should also be aware of the limitation of the model. It can not account for timevaring trend ination, which a¤ects also the coe¢ cients in the NKPC (Cogley and Sbordone, 2008). As a result, the general-pricing-hazard model is only suitable to model a economy with a stable monetary policy regime.

B Proof

In the Calvo pricing case, all hazards are equal to a constant between zero and one. Denote the constant hazard as h = 1 , and substitute it into the NKPC (18):

X1

^t +

k ^t k = (1

X1 ) kEt k (1

X1 X1 ! ) i imct+i k + i i ^t+i k

k=1

) i i ^t+i 2

i=0 i=0

...: (27)

Iterate this equation one period forward, I obtain

^t+1 + ^t + 2 ^t 1 + 3 ^t 2

= Et+1 (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i+1 + (1

! X1 ) i i ^t+i+1

i=0 i=0

...:

Use equation (27) to substitute terms in the left hand side of the equation (^t; ^t 1; ^t 2 ), I get

24

^t+1 + Et (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i + (1

i=0 i=0

...

After canceling out equal terms from both sides of the equation, It yields the following equation:

^t+1 = Et+1 (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i+1 + (1
i=0

! X1 ) i i ^t+i+1
i=0

Lag this equation and rearrange it, I obtain the NKPC of the Calvo model.

^t = Et (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i + (1

X1 ! ) i i ^t+i

i=0 i=0

^t = (1 )(1

)mct + (1 )^t + Et (^t+1)

(1 )(1 ^t =
