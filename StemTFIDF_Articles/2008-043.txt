June 16, 2008
Abstract In this paper we provide a review of copula theory with applications to finance. We illustrate the idea on the bivariate framework and discuss the simple, elliptical and Archimedean classes of copulae. Since the copulae model the dependency structure between random variables, next we explain the link between the copulae and common dependency measures, such as Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho. In the next section the copulae are generalized to the multivariate case. In this general setup we discuss and provide an intensive literature review of estimation and simulation techniques. Separate section is devoted to the goodness-of-fit tests. The importance of copulae in finance we illustrate on the example of asset allocation problems, Value-at-Risk and time series models. The paper is complemented with an extensive simulation study and an application to financial data.

1 Modeling Dependencies with Copulae
Wolfgang H¨ardle, Ostap Okhrin and Yarema Okhrin
1.1 Introduction
The modeling and estimation of multivariate distributions is one of the most critical issues in financial and economic applications. The distributions are usually restricted to the class of multivariate elliptical distributions. This limits the analysis to a very narrow class of candidate distribution and requires the estimation of a large number of parameters. Two further problems are illustrated in Figure 1.1. The scatter plot in the first figure shows realizations of two Gaussian random variables, the points are symmetric and no extreme outliers can be observed. In contrast, the second picture exhibits numerous outliers. The outliers in the first and third quadrants show that extreme values often occur simultaneously for both variables. Such behavior is observed in crisis periods, when strong negative movements on financial markets occur simultaneously. In the third figure we observe that the dependency between negative values is different compared to positive values. This type of non-symmetric dependency cannot be modeled by elliptical distributions, because they impose a very specific radially symmetric dependency structure. Both types of dependencies are often observed in financial applications. The assumption of Gaussian distribution is therefore rarely consistent with the empirical evidence and possibly leads to incorrect inferences from financial models. Moreover, the correlation coefficient is equal for all three samples, despite clear differences in the dependencies. This questions the suitability of the correlation coefficient as the key measure of dependence for financial data.
The seminal result of Sklar (1959) provides a partial solution to these problems. It allows the separation of marginal distributions from the dependency structure between the random variables. Since the theory on modeling and estimation of univariate distributions is well established compared to the multivariate case, the initial problem reduces to modeling the dependency by copulae. This approach has several important advantages. Firstly, it dramatically widens the class of candidate distribution. Secondly, it allows a simple

construction of distributions with less parameters than imposed by elliptical models. Thirdly, the copula-based models reflect the real-world relationships on financial markets better.
The purpose of this chapter is twofold. Firstly, to provide the theoretical background, dealing with the estimation, simulation and testing of copulabased models, and secondly, to discuss several important applications of copulae to financial problems. The chapter is structured as follows. The next section provides a review of bivariate copulae. Here we also consider different copula families and dependency measures. The third section extends the discussion to a multivariate framework. The fourth and fifth sections provide estimation and simulation techniques. The final section illustrates the use of copulae in financial problems. We omit all proofs and follow the notation used in Joe (1997).

1.2 Bivariate Copulae
Modeling and measuring the dependency between two random variables using copulae is the subject of this section. There are several equivalent definitions of the copula function. We define it as a bivariate distribution function with both marginal distributions being uniform on [0, 1].
DEFINITION 1.1 The bivariate copula is a function C: [0, 1]2  [0, 1] with the following properties:
1. For every u1, u2  [0, 1] C(u1, 0) = 0 = C(0, u2). 2. For every u1, u2  [0, 1] C(u1, 1) = u1 and C(1, u2) = u2. 3. For every (u1, u2), (u1, u2)  [0, 1]2 such that u1  u2 and u1  u2
C(u2, u2) - C(u2, u1) - C(u1, u2) + C(u1, u1)  0.

Copulae gained their popularity due to a seminal paper by Sklar (1959), where this term was first coined. The separation of the bivariate distribution function into the copula function and margins is formalized in the next theorem (Nelsen (2006), Theorem 2.3.3).

PROPOSITION 1.1 Let F be a bivariate distribution function with margins F1 and F2, then there exists a copula C such that

F (x1, x2) = C{F1(x1), F2(x2)}, x1, x2  R.

(1.1)

If F1 and F2 are continuous then C is unique. Otherwise C is uniquely determined on F1(R) × F2(R).
Conversely, if C is a copula and F1 and F2 are univariate distribution functions, then function F in (1.1) is a bivariate distribution function with margins F1 and F2.

The theorem allows us to depart an arbitrary continuous bivariate distribution into its marginal distributions and the dependency structure. The latter is defined by the copula function.
The representation (1.1) also shows how new bivariate distributions can be constructed. We can extend the class of standard elliptical distributions by keeping the same elliptical copula function and varying the marginal distributions or vice versa. Going further we can take elliptical margins and impose some non-symmetric form of dependency by considering non-elliptical copulae. This shows that copulae substantially widen the family of elliptical distributions. To determine the copula function of a given bivariate distribution we use the transformation

C(u1, u2) = F {F1-1(u1), F2-1(u2)}, u1, u2  [0, 1],

(1.2)

where Fi-1, i = 1, 2 are generalized inverses of the marginal distribution functions.

Since the copula function is a bivariate distribution with uniform margins, it follows that the copula density could be determined in the usual way

c(u1,

u2)

=

2C(u1, u2), u1u2

u1, u2  [0, 1].

(1.3)

Being armed with the Theorem 1.1 and (1.3) we could write density function f (·) of the bivariate distribution F in terms of copula as follows

f (x1, x2) = c{F1(x1), F2(x2)}f1(x1)f2(x2), x1, x2  R.

6 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.
A very important property of copulae is given in Theorem 2.4.3 in Nelsen (2006), in it, it is shown that copula is invariant under strictly monotone transformations. This implies that the copulae capture only those features of the joint distribution, which are invariant under increasing transformations.
1.2.1 Copula Families
Naturally there is an infinite number of different copula functions satisfying the assumptions of Definition 1. In this section we discuss in details three important sub-classes of simple, elliptical and Archimedean copulae.
Simplest Copulae
We are often interested in some extreme, special cases, like independence and perfect positive or negative dependence. If two random variables X1 and X2 are stochastically independent, from the Theorem 1.1 the structure of such a relationship is given by the product (independence) copula defined as
(u1, u2) = u1u2, u1, u2  [0, 1].
The contour diagrams of the bivariate density function with product copula and either Gaussian or t-distributed margins are given in Figure 1.2. Another two extremes are the lower and upper Fr´echet-Hoeffding bounds. They represent the perfect negative and positive dependences respectively
W (u1, u2) = max(0, u1+u2-1) and M (u1, u2) = min(u1, u2), u1, u2  [0, 1]. If C = W and (X1, X2)  C(F1, F2) then X2 is a decreasing function of X1. Similarly, if C = M , then X2 is an increasing function of X1. In general we can argue that an arbitrary copula which represents some dependency structure lies between these two bounds, i.e.
W (u1, u2)  C(u1, u2)  M (u1, u2), u1, u2  [0, 1].
The bounds serve as benchmarks for the evaluation of the dependency magnitude.
Elliptical Family
Due to the popularity of Gaussian and t-distributions in financial applications, the elliptical copulae also play an important role. The construction of

1 Modeling Dependencies with Copulae

this type of copulae is based directly on the Theorem 1.1 and (1.2). By the Theorem 2.3.7 of Nelsen (2006) bivariate copula is elliptical (has reflection symmetry) if and only if

C(u1, u2, ) = u1 + u2 - 1 + C(1 - u1, 1 - u2, ), u1, u2  [0, 1].

From (1.2) the Gaussian copula and its copula density are given by

in Figure 1.2. The t-distributed margins lead to more mass and variability

in the tails of the distribution. However, the curves are symmetric, which

reflects the ellipticity of the underlying copula.

In the bivariate case the t-copula and its density are given by

where  denotes the correlation coefficient,  is the number of degrees of
freedom. f and f are joint and marginal t-distributions respectively, while t-1 denotes the quantile function of the t distribution. In-depth analysis of the t-copula is done in Demarta and McNeil (2004).

Using (1.2) we can derive the copula function for an arbitrary elliptical distribution. The problem is, however, that such copulae depend on the inverse distribution functions and these are rarely available in an explicit form. Therefore, the next class of copulae and their generalizations provide an important flexible and rich family of alternatives to the elliptical copulae.

Archimedean Family
Opposite to elliptical copulae, the Archimedean copulae are not constructed using (1.2), but are related to Laplace transforms of bivariate distribution

8 Wolfgang Ha¨rdle et al.

functions (see Section 1.6.2). Let L denote the class of Laplace transforms which consists of strictly decreasing differentiable functions Joe (1997), i.e.

L = { : [0; )  [0, 1] | (0) = 1, () = 0; (-1)j(j)  0; j = 1, . . . , }.
The function C : [0, 1]2  [0, 1] defined as
C(u1, u2) = {-1(u1) + -1(u2)}, u1, u2  [0, 1]
is a 2-dimensional Archimedean copula, where   L and is called the generator of the copula. It is straightforward to show that C(u1, u2) satisfies the conditions of Definition 1. The generator usually depends on some parameters, however, generators with a single parameter  are mainly considered. Joe (1997) and Nelsen (2006) provide a thoroughly classified list of popular generators for Archimedean copulae and discuss their properties. The most useful in financial applications (see Patton (2004)) appears to be the Gumbel copula with the generator function
(x, ) = exp (-x1/), 1   < , x  [0, ].

It leads to the copula function

C(u1, u2, ) = exp - (- log u1) + (- log u2) 1/ , 1   < , u1, u2  [0, 1].

Consider a bivariate distribution based on the Gumbel copula with univariate extreme valued marginal distributions. Genest and Rivest (1989) show that this distribution is the only bivariate extreme value distribution based on an Archimedean copula. Moreover, all distributions based on Archimedean copulae belong to its domain of attraction under common regularity conditions.
In contrary to the elliptical copulae, the Gumbel copula leads to asymmetric contour diagrams in Figure 1.2. The Gumbel copula shows stronger linkage between positive values, however, more variability and more mass in the negative tail. The opposite is observed for the Clayton copula with the generator and copula functions

1.2.2 Dependence Measures

Since copulae define the dependency structure between random variables, there is a relationship between the copulae and different dependency measures. The classical measures for continuous random variables are Kendall's  and Spearman's . Similarly as copula functions, these measures are invariant under strictly increasing transformations. They are equal to 1 or -1 under perfect positive or negative dependence respectively. In contrast to  and , the Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear dependence and, therefore, is unsuitable for measuring nonlinear relationships. Next we discuss the relationship between  ,  and the underlying copula function.

DEFINITION 1.2 Let F be a continuous bivariate cumulative distribution function with the copula C. Moreover, let (X1, X2)  F and (X1, X2)  F be independent random pairs. Then Kendall's 2 is given by
2 = P{(X1 - X1)(X2 - X2) > 0} - P{(X1 - X1)(X2 - X2) < 0}
= 2P{(X1 - X1)(X2 - X2) > 0} - 1 = 4 C(u1, u2) dC(u1, u2) - 1.
[0,1]2

Kendall's  represents the difference between the probability of two random concordant pairs and the probability of two random discordant pairs.

For most copula functions with a single parameter  there is a one-to-one relationship between  and the Kendall's 2. For example, it holds that

2() = 0, 2(W ) = 1, 2(M ) = -1.

This implies, that for Gaussian, t and an arbitrary Archimedean copula we can estimate the unknown copula parameter  using a type of method of

moments procedure with a single moment condition. This requires, however, an estimator of 2. Naturally (Kendall (1970)) it is computed by
4 ^2n = n(n - 1)Pn - 1,
where n stands for the sample size and Pn denotes the number of concordant pairs, e.g. such pairs (X1, X2) and (X1, X2) that (X1 - X1)(X2 - X2) > 0. However, as argued by Genest, Ghoudi and Rivest (1995) the MM estimator of copula parameters is highly inefficient (see Section 1.4). Next we provide the definition and similar results for the Spearman's .

DEFINITION 1.3 Let F be a continuous bivariate distribution function
with the copula C and the univariate margins F1 and F2 respectively. Assume that (X1, X2)  F . Then the Spearman's  is given by

2 = 12 F1(x1)F2(x2) dF (x1, x2) - 3 = 12 u1u2 dC(u1, u2) - 3.

1.3 Multivariate Copulae
In this section we generalize the above theory to the multivariate case. First we define the copula function and state Sklar's theorem.

12 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.

DEFINITION 1.4 A d-dimensional copula is a function C: [0, 1]d  [0, 1] with the following properties:
1. C(u1, . . . , ud) is increasing in each component ui  [0, 1], i = 1, . . . , d. 2. C(1, . . . , 1, ui, 1, . . . , 1) = ui for all ui  [0, 1], i = 1, . . . , d. 3. For all (u1, . . . , ud), (u1, . . . , ud)  [0, 1]d with ui < ui we have
22
· · · (-1)i1+···+idC(vj1, . . . , vjd)  0,
i1=1 id=1
where vj1 = uj and vj2 = uj, for all j = 1, . . . , d.
Thus a d-dimensional copula is the distribution function on [0, 1]d where all marginal distributions are uniform on [0,1]. In the Sklar's theorem the very importance of copulae in the area of multivariate distributions has been recapitulated in an exquisite way.

PROPOSITION 1.2 (Sklar (1959)) Let F be a multivariate distribution function with margins F1, . . . , Fd, then there exists the copula C such that
F (x1, . . . , xd) = C{F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)}, x1, . . . , xd  R.
If Fi are continuous for i = 1, . . . , d then C is unique. Otherwise C is uniquely determined on F1(R) × · · · × Fd(R).
Conversely, if C is a copula and F1, . . . , Fd are univariate distribution functions, then function F defined above is a multivariate distribution function with margins F1, . . . , Fd.

The representation in Sklar's Theorem can be used to construct new multivariate distributions by changing either the copula function or the marginal distributions. For an arbitrary continuous multivariate distribution we can determine its copula from the transformation

C(u1, . . . , ud) = F {F1-1(u1), . . . , Fd-1(ud)}, u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1], (1.4)
where Fi-1 are inverse marginal distribution functions. Copula density and density of the multivariate distribution with respect to copula are

d

f (x1, . . . , xd) = c{F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd)} fi(xi), x1, . . . , xd  R.

For the multivariate case as well as for the bivariate case copula function is invariant under monotone transformations.

1 Modeling Dependencies with Copulae

1.3.1 Copula Families

It is straightforward to generalize the independence copula and the upper and lower Fr´echet-Hoeffdings bounds to the multivariate case. The independence copula is defined by the product

d
(u1, . . . , ud) = ui.
i=1
The upper and lower Fr´echet-Hoeffdings bounds are given by

d
W (u1, . . . , ud) = max 0, ui + 1 - d ,
i=1
M (u1, . . . , ud) = min(u1, . . . , ud), u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1].

respectively. An arbitrary copula C(u1, . . . , ud) lies between the upper and lower Fr´echet-Hoeffdings bounds

W (u1, . . . , ud)  C(u1, . . . , ud)  M (u1, . . . , ud).

Note, however, that the lower Fr´echet-Hoeffding bound is not a copula function for d > 2.

The generalization of elliptical copulae to d > 2 is straightforward. In the Gaussian case we have:

CN (u1, . . . , ud, ) = {-1(u1), . . . , -1(ud)}, cN (u1, . . . , ud, ) = ||-1/2×
exp -[-1(u1), . . . , -1(ud)](-1 - I)[-1(u1), . . . , -1(uk)] 2
for all u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1],

,

where  is a d-dimensional normal distribution with zero mean and the correlation matrix . The variances of the variables are imposed by the marginal distributions. Note, that in the multivariate case the implementation of elliptical copulae is very involved due to technical difficulties with multivariate cdf's.

Archimedean and Hierarchical Archimedean copulae
In contrast to the bivariate case, the multivariate setting allows construction methods for copulae. The simplest multivariate generalization of the

14 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.

Archimedean copulae is C : [0, 1]d  [0, 1] and is defined as

C(u1, . . . , ud) = {-1(u1) + · · · + -1(ud)}, u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1], (1.5)

where   L. This definition provides a simple, but rather limited technique for the construction of multivariate copulae. The whole complex multivariate
dependency structure is determined by a single copula parameter. Further-
more, the multivariate Archimedean copulae imply that the variables are ex-
changeable. This means, that the distribution of (u1, . . . , ud) is the same as of (uj1, . . . , ujd) for all j = jv. This is certainly not an acceptable assumption in practical applications.

A much more flexible method is provided by hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC), discussed by Joe (1997), Whelan (2004), Savu and Trede (2006), Embrechts, Lindskog and McNeil (2003), Okhrin, Okhrin and Schmid (2007). In the most general case of fully nested copulae, the copula function is given by

C(u1, . . . , ud) = d-1 -d-11  d-2 . . . [2-1  1{1-1(u1) + -1 1(u2)} (1.6) + 2-1(u3)] + · · · + d--12(ud-1) + -d-11(ud) = d-1[d--11  C({1, . . . , d-2})(u1, . . . , ud-1) + d--11(ud)]
for -d-1i  d-j  L, i < j, where
L = { : [0; )  [0, ) | (0) = 0, () = ; (-1)j-1(j)  0; j = 1, . . . , },

and "" is the composition operator. In contrast to the usual Archimedean copula (1.5), the HAC defines the whole dependency structure in a recursive way. At the lowest level, the dependency between the first two variables is modeled by a copula function with the generator 1, i.e. z1 = C(u1, u2) = 1{1-1(u1) + 1-1(u2)}. At the second level another copula function is used to model the dependency between z1 and u3, etc. Note, that the generators i can come from the same family and differ only through the parameter or, to introduce more flexibility, come from different generator families. As an alternative to the fully nested model, we can consider copula functions, with arbitrary chosen combinations at each copula level, so-called partially nested copulae. For example the following 4-dimensional copula, where the first and the last two variables are joined by individual copulae with generators 12 and 34. Further, the resulted copulae are combined by a copula with the generator .

C(u1, u2, u3, u4) =  -1[12{-121(u1) + 1-21(u2)}] + -1[34{-341(u3) + -341(u4)}] .

Whelan (2004) and McNeil (2007) provide tools for generating samples from Archimedean copulae, Savu and Trede (2006) derived the density of such copulae and Joe (1997) proves their positive quadrant dependence (see Theorem 4.4). Okhrin et al. (2007) considered methods for determining the optimal structure of the HAC and provided asymptotic theory for the estimated parameters.

1.3.2 Dependence Measures

MMeasuring dependence in a multivariate framework is a tedious task. This is due to the fact that, the generalizations of bivariate measures are not unique. One of the multivariate extensions of the Kendall's  and its estimator is proposed in Barbe, Genest, Ghoudi and R´emillard (1996)

[0, 1]. Kn(t) and K(t) are distribution functions of Vin and V respectively.

The expression in (1.8) implies that d is an affine transformation of the ex-

pectation of the value of the copula. Genest and Rivest (1993) and Barbe

et al. (1996) provide in-depth investigation and derivation of the distribution

K.

A multivariate extension of Spearman's  based on multivariate copula was introduced in Wolff (1980):

d+1 d = 2d - (d + 1)

2d

[0,1]d

Schmid and Schmidt (2006a) and Schmid and Schmidt (2006b) discuss its properties and provide a detailed analysis of its estimator given by

d + 1 2d n ^dn = 2d - d - 1 n

A version of the pairwise Spearman's  was introduced in Kendall (1970)

where Cml denotes the bivariate copula of the variables m and l.

Generalizations
There are numerous techniques which allow for the construction of new types of copulae from simple, elliptical or Archimedean copulae. For example, copula families B11 and B12 (Joe (1997)) arise as a combination of the upper Fr´echet-Hoeffding bound and the product copula
CB11(u1, u2, ) = M (u1, u3) + (1 - )(u1, u2) =  min{u1, u2} + (1 - )u1u2,
CB12(u1, u2, ) = M (u1, u2)1-(u1, u2) = (min{u1, u2})(u1u2)1-, u1, u2,   [0, 1].
For the family B11 we used the property, that every convex combination of copulae is a copula too. Family B12 is also known as Spearman or CuadrasAug´e copula, which is a weighted geometric mean of the upper Fr´echetHoeffding bound and the product copula. Further generalization is done by using power mean over the upper Fr´echet-Hoeffding bound and the product copula
Cp(u1, u2, 1, 2) = {1M 2(u1, u2) + (1 - 1)2(u1, u2)}1/2 = {1 min(u1, u2)2 + (1 - 1)(u1u2)2}1/2, 1  [0, 1], 2  R.
Nelsen (2006), Chapter 3 provides further methods of constructing multivariate copulae, one of them is based on the Archimedean n-copulae. This family of copulae arises from simple multivariate Archimedean copula from reparametrization  = e-t. We get
C(u1, . . . , ud) = -1{(u1) . . . (ud)} = -1[{(u1), . . . , (ud)}].
The function  is known as a multiplicative generator of C. Replacing product copula  with an arbitrary copula C1 of dimension d we get a new copula family, investigated in Morillas (2005).
Another popular approach to modeling multivariate distributions is based on vines. This class was introduced in Joe (1996) and then discussed by Bedford and Cooke (2001), Bedford and Cooke (2002), Kurowicka and Cooke (2006), Aas, Czado, Frignessi and Bakken (2006) and Berg and Aas (2007). The idea is based on the decomposition of a multivariate density into d(d - 1)/2 bivariate densities. In the literature we have only come accross two types of

1 Modeling Dependencies with Copulae

17

such structures D-vines and canonical vines. For the D-vine the density is

f (x1, . . . , xd) =

d d-1 d-j

= f (xm)

cji{F (xi|xi+1, . . . , xi+j-1), F (xi+j|xi+1, . . . , xi+j-1)},

m=1

j=1 i=1

where the conditional distribution is computed as a derivative with respect to known arguments (in details in Sections 2.5 and 2.6.1). To get the copula function we integrate the density over the d-dimensional hyper cube. As noted by Berg and Aas (2007) there are only d(d - 1)/2 possible copulae to be described using vines. For d = 10 it is only 45 different models, while using HAC as in Okhrin et al. (2007) more than 300 million copulae are available. However the estimation of the parameters of the model and simulation from the copula are faster when vines are used.

1.4 Estimation Methods
The estimation of a copula-based multivariate distribution involves both the estimation of the copula parameters  and the estimation of the margins Fj, j = 1, . . . , d. The properties and quality of the estimator of  heavily depend on the estimators of Fj, j = 1, . . . , d. We distinguish between a parametric and a nonparametric specification of the margins. If we are interested only in the dependency structure, the estimator of  should be independent of any parametric models for the margins. In practical applications, however, we are interested in a complete distribution model and, therefore, parametric models for margins are preferred (see Joe (1997)).
In the bivariate case a standard method of estimating the univariate parameter  is based on Kendall's  statistic by Genest and Rivest (1993). The estimator of  complemented by the method of moments allows for the estimation of the parameters. However, as shown in Genest et al. (1995) the maximum-likelihood method lead to substantially more efficient and general estimators. For non-parametrically estimated margins, Genest et al. (1995) show the consistency and asymptotic normality of ML estimators and derive the moments of the asymptotic distribution. The maximum-likelihood estimation can be performed simultaneously for the parameters of the margins and of the copula function. Alternatively, a two-stage procedure can be applied, where we estimate the parameters of margins at the first stage and the copula parameters at the second stage (see Joe (1997), Joe (2005)). Fermanian and Scaillet (2003), Chen, Fan and Patton (2004) and Chen, Fan and Tsyrennikov (2006) analyze the case of nonparametrically estimated margins.

18 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.

Chen and Huang (2007) considered a fully nonparametric estimation of the copula. Next we provide details on both approaches.

Parametric margins

Let  = (1 , . . . , d ) denote the vector of parameters of marginal distributions and  parameters of the copula. The classical full ML estimator ^
of  = ( ,  ) solves the system

L(, X) 
where L(, X)

= 0,
nd
= log c{F1(x1i, 1), . . . , Fd(xdi, d), } fj(xji, j)
i=1 j=1 n
= log c{F1(x1i, 1), . . . , Fd(xdi, d), }
i=1 d
+ log fj(xji, j) .
j=1

Following the standard theory on ML estimation, the estimator is efficient and asymptotically normal, however, it is often computationally demanding to solve the system simultaneously. Alternatively the multistage optimization proposed in Joe (1997), Chapter 10 also known as inference of margins, can be applied. First, we estimate separately the parameters of the margins and then use them in the estimation of the copula parameters as known quantities. The above optimization problem is then replaced by

where

L1 , . . . , Ld , Ld+1 1 d 
n

= 0,

Lj = lj(Xi), for j = 1, . . . , d + 1,

i=1

lj(Xi) = log fj(xji, j), for j = 1, . . . , d, i = 1, . . . , n,

(1.10)

ld+1(Xi) = log c F1(x1i, 1), . . . , Fd(xdi, d) , for i = 1, . . . , n.

The first d components in (1.10) correspond to the usual ML estimation of the parameters of the marginal distributions. The last component reflects the estimation of the copula parameters. Detailed discussion on this method could be found in Joe and Xu (1996). Note, that this procedure does not lead to efficient estimators; however, as argued by Joe (1997) the loss in the

1 Modeling Dependencies with Copulae

19

efficiency is modest. The advantage of the two-stage procedure lies in the dramatic reduction of the numerical complexity. This is especially pronounced in the case of hierarchical Archimedean copulae (see Okhrin et al. (2007)). This method is a special case of the generalized method of moments with an identity weighting matrix (see Cherubini, Luciano and Vecchiato (2004), Section 4.5).

Canonical Maximum Likelihood

In this section we consider a nonparametric estimation of the marginal distributions. The asymptotic properties of the multistage estimators of  do not depend explicitly on the type of the nonparametric estimator, but on its convergence properties. Here we use the rectangular kernel (histogram). The estimator is given by

F^j (x)

=

n

1 +

1

n

1(xji  x),

j = 1, . . . , d.

i=1

The factor n/(n+1) is used to bound the cdf from one. Let F^1, . . . , F^d denote the nonparametric estimators of F1, . . . , Fd. The canonical ML estimator ^ of
 solves the system by maximizing the pseudo log-likelihood with estimated margins F^1, . . . , F^d, i.e.

where

L = 0,

n
L = l(Xi),
i=1
l(Xi) = log c F^1(x1i), . . . , F^d(xdi)

, for i = 1, . . . , n.

As in the parametric case, the semiparametric estimator ^ is asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions. This method was first used in Oakes (2005) and then investigated by Genest et al. (1995) and Shih and Louis (1995). For properties we refer to these papers.

1.5 Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae
In this section we review the goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests for copulae. With the GOF tests we test whether the underlying copula is equal to some target

20 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.

copula function or belongs to some copula family. The test problem could be written as a composite or a simple null hypothesis

H0 : C  C0, against H1 : C / C0,

H0 : C = C0, against H1 : C = C0,
where C0 is some known parametric family of copulae, C0 is some known target copula and C is the underlying true copula. The test problem is in general equivalent to the GOF tests for multivariate distributions. However, since the margins are estimated we cannot apply the standard test procedures directly.

Several related tests have been introduced into the literature. As a simple generalization of the standard 2 an adopted 2-test is proposed in Fermanian (2005) (Section 2) which is based directly on the distance between C and C0. Genest and Rivest (1993) consider, in a bivariate setup, a test based on the true and empirical distributions of the pseudo-variable Z = C0(X, Y ). As a measure they use the L2 norm. This approach is extended to the multivariate case and other measures of proximity by Barbe et al. (1996), Wang and Wells (2000), Genest, Quessy and R´emillard (2006). Wang and Wells (2000) propose to compute a Cr´amer-von-Mises statistic of the form
1
Sn = {Kn(w) - K(w)}2 dw,   (0, 1),

where Kn(w) and K(w) are empirical and theoretical K-distributions from Section 2.3.2. However exact p-values for this statistic cannot be computed explicitly. Savu and Trede (2004) propose a 2-test based on the K-distribution. Tests of LR type were proposed in Chen and Fan (2005). Unfortunately in most cases the distribution of the test statistic does not follow a standard distribution and either bootstrap or other computationally intensive methods should be used.

An alternative approach is based on the probability integral transform introduced in Rosenblatt (1952) and applied in Breymann, Dias and Embrechts (2003), Chen et al. (2004). The idea of the transformation is to construct the variables

Y1 = F1(X1), Yj = C0{Fj(Xj)|F1(X1), . . . , Fj-1(Xj-1)}, for j = 2, . . . , d,

where the conditional copula is defined as

C0(uj|u1, . . . , uj-1) =

21

Under H0 the variables Yi, for i = 1, . . . , d are independently and uniformly
distributed on [0, 1]. Since the variables Yi are not directly observable, we compute the pseudo variables Y^ji defined by

Y^1i = F^1(X1i), Y^ji = C{F^j(Xji)|F^1(X1i), . . . , F^j-1(Xj-1,i)},

(1.11)

for j = 2, . . . , d, i = 1, . . . , n. Chen et al. (2004) proposed two tests based on
Y^ji. Both can be used for our purposes, however here we discuss the second test. Consider the variable W = dj=1[-1(Yj)]2. Under H0 it holds that W  2d. Similarly as Yj's, W is not observed and its pseudo-observations are computed as W^ i = dj=1[-1(Yji)]2. Breymann et al. (2003) assume that estimating margins and copula parameters does not significantly affect the distribution of W^ i and apply a standard 2 test directly to the pseudo-
observations.

Chen et al. (2004) develop a kernel-based test for the distribution of W and,

thus, account for estimation errors. Let g^W (w) denote the kernel estimator

of the density of W , i.e.

g^W (w)

=

1 nh

n i=1

Kh{w,

Fd2

(W^ i)},

where

Kh

is

the univariate boundary kernel with the second order kernel function k(·).

Under H0 the density gW (w) is equal to one. As a measure of divergency we use J^n = 01{g^W (w) - 1}2dw. Assuming non-parametric estimator of the
marginal distributions Chen et al. (2004) prove under regularity conditions

that 
Tn = (n hJ^n - cn)/  N(0, 1),

where the parameters are defined in Chen et al. (2004). The proof of this statement does not depend explicitly on the type of the non-parametric estimator of the marginals Fi, but uses the order of F^j(Xji)-Fj(Xji) as a function of n. It can be shown that if the parametric families of marginal distributions are correctly specified and their parameters are consistently estimated, then the statement holds also if we use parametric estimators for marginal distributions. Since the test is distribution-free it is convenient to use it as a GOF measure for different copulae in different dimensions. Moreover as argued by Chen et al. (2004), the power and size of the test are comparable with other more sophisticated tests.

1.6 Simulation Methods
Monte-Carlo simulations are often a single reliable solution method in many financial problems. Within the simulation study the random variables are

22 Wolfgang Ha¨rdle et al.
generated from some prescribed distributions. There are numerous methods of simulating from copula-based distributions (see Frees and Valdez (1998), Whelan (2004), Marshall and Olkin (1988), McNeil (2007), Embrechts, McNeil and Straumann (1999), Frey and McNeil (2003), Devroye (1986), etc.). Here we focus on two of them, on the conditional inversion method and on the method proposed by Marshall and Olkin (1988) for Archimedean copulae with generalizations to hierarchical Archimedean copulae by McNeil (2007).

1.6.1 Conditional Inverse Method

The conditional inverse method is a general approach aimed of simulating
random variables from an arbitrary multivariate distribution. Here we sketch
this method on the example of simulating from copulae. The idea is to gen-
erate random variables recursively from the conditional distributions. Let u1, . . . , ud be the sample we generate and let v1, . . . , vd  U (0, 1) be a uniformly distributed random sample. We set u1 = v1. The rest of the variables we generate using the recursion ui = Ci-1(vi|u1, . . . , ui-1) for i = 2, . . . , d, where Ci = C(u1, . . . , ui, 1, . . . , 1) and the conditional distribution of Ui is given by

i-1Ci(u1,...,ui)

Ci(ui|u1, . . . , ui-1) = P(Ui



ui|U1

=

u1 . . . Ui-1

= ui-1) =

.u1...ui-1
i-1Ci-1(u1,...,ui-1)

u1...ui-1

The method is numerically expensive, since it depends on higher order derivatives of C and the inverse of the conditional distribution function.

1.6.2 Marshal-Olkin Method

For simulating from Archimedean copulae a simpler method is introduced in Marshall and Olkin (1988). The idea of the method is based on the fact that the Archimedean copulae are derived from Laplace transforms. Let M be a univariate cumulative distribution function of a positive random variable (so that M (0) = 0) and  is the Laplace transform of M , i.e.


(s) = exp{-sw} dM (w), s  0.
0

For any univariate distribution function F , a unique distribution G exists

such that


F (x) = G(x) dM () = {- log G(x)}.

is a multivariate distribution function. To add even more generality we re-
place the product of univariate distributions Gi with an arbitrary copula
function R

C(u1, . . . , ud) = . . . R(G1, . . . , Gd) dM ().
00

Note that for the classical Archimedean copula R is equal to a product copula. Following the paper of Marshall and Olkin (1988) we proceed with the following three steps to make a draw from a distribution described by an Archimedean copula:

1. generate an observation u from M ;
2. generate observations (v1, . . . , vd) from R;
3. the generated vector is computed by x = {G1-1(v11/u), . . . , Gd-1(vd1/u)}.
This method works much faster than the classical conditional inverse technique. The drawback is that the distribution M can be determined explicitly only for a few generator functions . This can be done, for example, for Frank, Gumbel and Clayton families (see McNeil (2007), Marshall and Olkin (1988)). The same problem arises in the case of hierarchical copulae, where i  -i+11 should satisfy the properties of generator functions. A slightly modified but more simple procedure for simulating from hierarchical Archimedean copulae is considered in McNeil (2007).

1.7 Applications to Finance
The dependency plays a key role in many financial applications. Elliptical distributions, with the correlation coefficient as the main measure of dependency, constitute a well established class of dependency models commonly used in finance. However, the symmetry assumption and the imposed tail behavior do not reflect the empirical evidence on financial time series. This leads to numerous extensions of Gaussian models to copula-based distributions. In this section we discuss three such extensions. Firstly, we consider the asset allocation problem with non-Gaussian asset returns. Secondly, we discuss the peculiarities of the Value-at-Risk estimation in the non-elliptical framework. Thirdly, we consider the time series models with the residuals following a copula-based distribution.

24 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.

1.7.1 Asset Allocation

In this section we illustrate the extension of the classical asset allocation problem to copula-based models following Patton (2004). Further discussion and application of the impact of copula-based distribution on portfolio selection procedures can be found in Longin and Solnik (2001) and Hennessy and Lapan (2002).
We consider an investor with a CRRA utility function U (x) = (1 - )-1x1- willing to allocate his wealth to d risky assets. We denote the d-dimensional vector of continuously compounded asset returns at time t + 1 by rt+1 = (r1,t+1, . . . , rd,t+1) and the vector of portfolio weights by w = (w1, . . . , wd) . Let Ft+1 be the d-dimensional distribution function of rt+1 with the mean µt+1 and covariance matrix t+1. The aim is to forecast Ft+1 for the time period t + 1 using the data up to time t. The estimator is denoted by F^t+1 with the mean µ^t+1, the covariance matrix ^ t+1 and the density f^t+1. The objective of the investor is to maximize the expected utility at the time point t + 1. This leads to the optimization problem

max E U (1 + w rt+1).
wW

(1.12)

In the case of no-short-sales constraint we set W = {w  [0, 1]d : w 1 = 1} else we set W = {w  Rd : w 1 = 1}. The conditional expectation in
(1.12) implies that we integrate the utility with respect to the forecasted distribution F^t+1. This reduces the problem (1.12) to the problem

max · · · U (1 + w rt+1)f^t+1(rt+1)drt+1.
wW

There are several alternative parametric approaches to modeling Ft+1. Let
d,t+1 denote the diagonal matrix containing only the main diagonal of t+1. Then t+1 = 1d/,t2+1Rt+11d/,t2+1, where Rt+1 denotes the correlation matrix. A standard approach is to define the model of the asset returns in the form

-d,1t/2(rt - µt)  Nd(0, Rt),

(1.13)

where the conditional moments µt and t are modeled by a GARCH-in-mean type of process (Franke, H¨ardle and Hafner (2008)). As a simpler alternative we can consider a Bayesian framework where Ft+1 denotes the predictive distribution of the asset returns as in Barberis (2000). The unknown parameters of the conditional moments are usually estimated numerically using the ML methodology.

To introduce a copula-based distribution into the asset allocation we deviate from the normality assumption and, following the Sklar's theorem, assume

1 Modeling Dependencies with Copulae

25

that F = C(F1, . . . , Fd). Thus the model (1.14) is replaced with the model

d-,1t/2(rt - µt)  C(F1, . . . , Fd)

(1.14)

with some given functional forms of the copula and the marginal distributions. Similarly as above, the parameters of the conditional moments, of the copula and of the marginal distributions are estimated using the ML method.

In Patton (2004) the investor allocates his wealth between small cap and large cap stocks (i.e. d = 2). The conditional mean is defined as linear function of the lagged asset returns and additional explanatory variables. The conditional variance is stated in the TARCH(1,1) form. The rotated Gumbel copula with skewed t margins are used to construct the bivariate distribution of the residuals. This model reveals the highest likelihood function and the lowest AIC and BIC criterion. It is concluded that unconstrained portfolios derived from the normality assumption performed worse in 9 of 10 different trading strategies compared to the Gumbel model.

1.7.2 Value-at-Risk

One of the main advantages of copulae is the fact that they allow for flexible

modeling of the tail behavior of multivariate distributions. Since the tail

behavior explains the simultaneous outliers of asset returns, it is of special

interest in risk management. Therefore, in this section we illustrate the

use of copulae for computing the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of portfolios following

Embrechts et al. (1999) and Junker and May (2005). The VaR of a portfolio

at level  is defined as the lower -quantile of the distribution of the portfolio

return rp = w r, i.e.

V aR() = Fr-p1().

The VaR is a reasonable measure of risk if we assume that the returns are

elliptically distributed. This follows from the fact that VaR is a coherent

risk measure (see Embrechts et al. (1999)). Moreover, the assumption of

ellipticity implies that minimizing the variance in the Markowitz problem also

minimizes the VaR, the expected shortfall and any other coherent measure

of risk. However, this statement is false in the non-elliptical case. Moreover,

regarding the effect of diversification the variance is the smallest (highest)

for perfect negative (positive) correlation of the assets. This also holds for

the VaR in the elliptical case, however, not for the non-elliptical distributions

(see Embrechts et al. (1999), Theorem 5). This implies that for copula-based

distribution the VaR should be used with caution and its computation should

be awarded more attention.

26 Wolfgang Ha¨rdle et al.

Consider the probability that the portfolio return rp does not exceed some predetermined value , i.e. P(rp  ). Our aim is to determine the lower -quantile of the distribution of rp, or, equivalently, to determine such  that P(rp  ) = . Note that
dd
rp = w r = wiri = wiFi-1(ui),
i=1 i=1
where Fi denote the marginal distributions of individual asset returns, ui = Fi(ri)  U [0, 1] for all i = 1, . . . , d and u1, . . . , ud  C. The copula C defines the dependency structure between the asset returns. This implies that

P(rp  ) = c(u1, . . . , ud)du1 . . . dud,
U

(1.15)

with

d-1
U = {[0, 1]d-1 × [0, ud()]}, ud() = Fd /wd - wiFi-1(ui)/wd .
i=1

For fixed , the VaR is determined by solving (1.15) numerically for . Direct multidimensional numerical integration is a tedious task which can be substantially simplified by using the Monte-Carlo integration. For this purpose we have to generate random samples from C using methods described in Section 1.6.

Junker and May (2005) apply the above methodology to a portfolio consisting of two assets, Hoechts and Volkswagen shares. The returns are standardized by the sample mean and the conditional volatility from the GARCH(1,1) process. The copula function is defined as a convex linear combination of the Frank copula and its survival copula. It is concluded that empirical or t-margins and asymmetric copula-based dependency structures provide the best fit in terms of 2 goodness-of-fit test of Diebold, Gunther and Tay (1998). Moreover, the VaR estimator from this model well approximates the empirical estimator. The assumption of Gaussian GARCH(1,1) standardized returns renders the worst results.

1.7.3 Time Series Modeling
Time series models constitute one of the most important tools in dealing with financial data. However, multivariate modeling used up to now does not properly describe financial and economic time series. The reason is that

1 Modeling Dependencies with Copulae

27

these models are mainly based on the Gaussian or on elliptical distributions. Nowadays there are numerous papers extending the classical time series models to model copula distributed residuals. First we consider the semiparametric copula-based multivariate dynamic model (SCOMDY) of Chen and Fan (2006). Let {yt , xt }tn=1 be stochastic processes, where xt contains the exogenous variables and the d-dimensional vector yt contains the variables of interest. Let Ft-1 denote the information up to the time point t. They specified the model in the following way
yt = µt(1) + Ht()t, where
 = {1 , 2 } µt(1) = (µ1,t(1), . . . , µd,t(1))
= E{yt|Ft-1} Ht() = diag{h1,t(), . . . , hd,t()}
= diag{h1,t(1, 2), . . . , hd,t(1, 2)} = diag E[{y1t - µt(1)}2|Ft-1], . . . , E[{ydt - µt(1)}2|Ft-1] .
µt(·) is the true conditional mean of the yt given Ft-1 and hjt(·) is the true conditional variance of the yjt given Ft-1. The residuals are assumed to be serially independent with zero mean and unit variances, i.e. E[jt] = 0 and E[j2t] = 1 for j = 1, . . . , d. The joint distribution of  is assumed to be given by C{F1(1), . . . , Fd(d)}, where the margins and the copula function are unknown. This general specification includes the standard processes GARCH, ARCH, VAR as special cases, however, it allows for much more flexibility in the choice of the dependency structure of the residuals. For example considering 1 = (1 , . . . , d ) , 2 = (1, . . . , d; 1, . . . , d; 1, . . . , d) , µt = (x1t1, . . . , xdtd) , Ht = diag{h1t, . . . , hdt} and the copula for  is assumed to be the Gaussian copula, where j > 0, j  0, j  0 and j+j < 1 for j = 1, . . . , d we get GARCH(1,1) model with normal innovations
yjt = xjtj + hjtjt hjt = j + jhj,t+1 + j(yj,t-1 - xj,t-1j)2, j = 1, . . . , d.
Chen and Fan (2006) consider maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters in these models and establish large sample properties when the copula is mis-specified. For the choice between two SCOMDY models they introduce a pseudo likelihood ratio test and provide the limiting distribution of the test statistic.
In contrast to the paper by Chen and Fan (2006), Fermanian and Scaillet (2003) consider a nonparametric estimation of copulae for time series and

28 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.
derived asymptotic properties of the kernel estimator of copulae. Further generalization is discussed in Giacomini, Ha¨rdle and Spokoiny (2008), where the parameter of the copula is assumed to be time dependent. The aim is to determine the periods with constant dependency structure.

1.8 Simulation Study and Empirical Results
In this section we illustrate the considered algorithms on simulated and realworld data. The next sub-section contains the simulation study, where we show that the aggregated binary structures outperform the alternative strategies of artificial data. In Section 1.8.2 we used Bayes and Akaike information criterion to compare the performance of the HAC-based model with the classical Gaussian and t-models on real data.

1.8.1 Simulation Study

Setup of the study

The aim of this simulation study is the comparison of grouping methods on

the example of simulated data. We consider two different true structures

s = (123)(45) and s = (12(34))5 with the Gumbel generator function given

by

-1 = {- log(u)},



=

exp(-u

1 

).

This naturally corresponds to the Gumbel copula. The parameters are set for the first structure equal to 123 = 4, 45 = 3 and (123)(45) = 2 and for the second structure to 34 = 4, 12(34) = 3 and (12(34))5 = 2. Without loss of generality the marginal distributions are taken as uniform on [0, 1]. We simulate a sample of 1000 observations. The procedure is repeated 101 times. This number is selected to simplify the interpretation and computation of median structures.
For the simulation we use the conditional inversion method. This method is also used by Frees and Valdez (1998) and Whelan (2004) and we discussed it in Section 1.6. The copula parameters are estimated using the multistage ML method with the nonparametric estimation of margins based on the Epanechnikov kernel. The vector of bandwidths h = {hi}i=1,...,d in the estimation of the density and in the estimation of the distribution function is based on the Silverman's rule of thumb.

Discussion of the results

The results of the simulation study are summarized in Table 1.1 for the first
structure and in Table 1.2 for the second structure. For each simulated data
set and for each structure we compare the fit and the structure obtained from
the grouping procedures. We consider the simple Archimedean copula (sAC)
and groupings based on the Chen et al. (2004) test statistics (Chen), on the
 (), binary copulae (binary) and aggregated binary copulae (binary aggr.). As benchmark models we consider the 5-dimensional multivariate normal distribution (N) with ^ and µ^ estimated from the data; the multivariate
Gaussian copula with nonparametric margins (Nnonparam.); the multivariate t-distribution with eight degrees of freedom and with ^ and µ^ estimated from
the data set (t8); the multivariate t-copula with eight degrees of freedom and nonparametric margins (tnonparam.).

For each grouping method and each benchmark we compute the KullbackLeibler divergence from the empirical distribution function as in Giacomini et al. (2008) and the test statistic of Chen et al. (2004). The KulbackLeibler functional for the distribution functions estimated using two different methods is

The Kullback-Leibler divergence for the multivariate distribution which is based on copula, can be regarded as a distance between two copula densities.

The first blocks of Table 1.1 and Table 1.2 contain the results for groupings based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The columns "K" contain the value of the Kullback-Leibler divergence which is the closest to the median divergence given in parenthesis. The corresponding structure and the test statistic of Chen et al. (2004) are given in the columns "copula structure" and "Chen." respectively. The variance of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is given in the last column. The same holds for the lower blocks of both tables, however, here we find the structure which has the test statistics of Chen et al. (2004) which is the closest to the median of the test statistics. Note that we provide the results for the median performance measures and not for the best replications of the simulation study. This makes the conclusions more robust.

The results show that the grouping method based on the aggregated binary structure is dominant. It provides for both structures the smallest KullbackLeibler divergence as well as the lowest test statistics. The simple binary copula also provides good results, however, we see that some of the parameters are very close. This indicates that the variables can be joined together

30 Wolfgang Ha¨rdle et al.

into an aggregated copula. Although, the method based on 's performs better than the benchmark strategies, it leads, however, to incorrect structures and much higher goodness-of-fit measures compared to the binary copula. The grouping based on the test statistic of Chen et al. (2004) provides very poor results, which indicates a low power of the test against similar structures. Similarly, the ignorance of the hierarchical structure of the distribution imposed by the simple Archimedean copulae leads to the worst results among copula-based methods. The comparison with normal and t-distributions is possible only on the basis of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We see that, despite of the substantially larger number of parameters, the normal and t-distributions cannot outperform the -based grouping methods. Thus we conclude that the proposed grouping methodology based on the aggregated binary structure provides robust and precise results. Moreover, the method is computationally more efficient than the considered alternatives.

13.11.1998 to 18.10.2007. Margins are estimated nonparametrically with Epanechnikov kernel, normal and t-distributed with three degrees of freedom. The results are given in Tables 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 respectively. For goodnessof-fit measures we choose BIC (Bayes or Schwarz Information Criteria) and AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) and provide the value of the likelihood as intermediate results.
We fit the following multivariate copula functions to the data: HAC with binary and binary aggregated structure, simple Archimedean copula. For comparison purposes we also provide the results for the multivariate normal distribution and multivariate t-distribution with eight degrees of freedom in each table. We also provide the optimal binary and aggregated binary HACs and the simple Archimedean copula for all types of the margins.
We calculate the maximum likelihood value as described in Section 1.4. For the copula-base distributions we use
n
M L = log{c(u1, . . . , ud, )f1(u1) . . . fd(ud)},
i=1
where c is the copula density and fi for i = 1, . . . , d are marginal densities. For the multivariate normal and t-distribution, we computed the likelihood

32 Wolfgang H¨ardle et al.

as
n
M L = log{f (u1, . . . , ud, )},
i=1
where f denotes the joint multivariate density function and  is the set of parameters. To penalize the likelihood for large number of parameters we consider the AIC and BIC criterion computed as

AIC = -2M L + 2m, BIC = -2M L + 2 log(m),

where m is the number of the parameters to be estimated. The values of ML for the best structure should the the highest, while AIC and BIC should be as small as possible.
We emphasize with bold font the best strategy in each column and with italic the worst strategies. We can conclude that the multivariate t distribution outperforms all other methods and shows the best results for all types of the margins. Nevertheless, note that with the properly selected marginal distributions and copula function, the HAC outperforms the normal distribution. Moreover, note that we considered only HACs based on the Gumbel generator functions. Alternative generator specifications and HACs dependent on several different generators may outperform the t-distribution as well.

1.9 Summary
In this chapter we provide a detailed review of the copula models in discrete time. We review the construction and simulation of bivariate and multivariate copula models. For practical applications we discuss the alternative estimation procedures and goodness-of-fit tests. Special attention is paid to the hierarchical Archimedean copulae. The chapter is complemented with an extensive simulation study and an application to financial data.
