Non-constant Hazard Function and Ination Dynamics
Fang Yao Humboldt Universität zu Berlin
Abstract This paper explores implications of nominal rigidity characterized by a non-constant hazard function for aggregate dynamics. I derive the NKPC under an arbitrary hazard function and parameterize it with the Weibull duration model. The resulting Phillips curve involves lagged ination and lagged expectations. It nests the Calvo NKPC as a limiting case in the sense that the e¤ects of both terms are canceled out under the constant-hazard assumption. Furthermore, I ...nd lagged ination always has negative coe¢ cients, thereby making it impossible to interpret ination persistence as intrinsic. The numerical evaluation shows that the increasing hazard function leads to hump-shaped impulse responses of ination to monetary shocks, and output leads ination.

1 Introduction
The Calvo pricing assumption (Calvo, 1983) has become predominant in the world of applied monetary analysis under nominal rigidity. Nevertheless, its ubiquity is neither based on theoretical soundness nor on empirical appeal. Instead, the main argument for using this approach is that it gives great tractability, making it useful to analyze various monetary policy issues. Recently, one of the main criticisms of the Calvo approach is that it implies a constant hazard function for the stochastic pricing behavior. Unfortunately, constant hazard functions are largely rejected by empirical evidence from the micro level data (See: e.g. Dhyne et al., 2006, and references cited therein)1. Given this conict between theory and empirical evidence, it is important to understand to which extent the constant hazard function is innocuous for aggregate dynamics implied by the model.
To tackle this question, I construct a generalized time-dependent model of nominal rigidity à la Wolman (1999) and derive the New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) conditional on an arbitrary hazard function. This model is useful to study the implications of nominal rigidity for the aggregate dynamics because it models price rigidity in the most general form, so that, except for the time-dependent pricing structure, its implications do not depend on any one speci...c price setting assumption.
In the analytical results, I show that the NKPC derived from the model involves components including lagged ination, forward-looking and lagged expectations of ination and real marginal costs. This version of the Phillips curve nests the Calvo case in the sense that, under a constant hazard function, e¤ects of lagged ination exactly cancel those of lagged expectations, so that only current real terms and future expectations of ination remain in the expression, as in the Calvo NKPC. In the general case, however, both lagged ination and ination expectations should be present. The reason why lagged ination and lagged expectations exert opposite e¤ects on the current ination is due to the following facts. On the one hand, sticky prices ensure that lagged expectations have a long lasting inuence on ination, in that higher expectations of marginal costs leads to higher ination. On the other hand, the "front-loading" e¤ect deters the current ination to react to a current economic condition. That means that a high level of past ination hinders the ability of current ination to continue on a high course. In the more general setting, both e¤ects work against each other, but in the Calvo model, these two e¤ects just cancel each other out.
Furthermore, I ...nd a general result relating to the debate on the nature of ination persistence. Starting with Fuhrer and Moore (1995), the older literature believed that the NKPC needs a signi...cant backward-looking component in order to generate the key feature of reducedform Phillips curve regression: the positive dependence of ination on its lags. More recently, however, a new consensus has been emerging in the literature, showing that ination persistence is mainly due to its time-varing persistent trend. Detrended ination has less signi...cant or even negative autocorrelations. (Cogley and Sbordone, 2006, Bils et al., 2009). For example, Cogley and Sbordone (2006) ...nd that when correctly accounting for the time-varing trend ination, the purely forward-looking model explains the persistence of the ination deviation from its trend
1 The results of those work on the empirical hazard function is not conclusive. Some ...nd strong support for increasing hazard functions (e.g. :Fougere et al., 2005, Goette et al., 2005), while others ...nd evidence in favour of decreasing hazards (e.g.:Alvarez, 2007, Campbell and Eden, 2005).

quite well. From my generalized NKPC, I ...nd that the coe¢ cients on lagged ination should always be negative, even after controlling for the e¤ects of lagged expectations of ination. In particular, I show that the lagged expectations of ination can be transformed into lagged ination and expectational errors, which reduce to white noises under rational expectations. After transforming all the lagged expectations into lagged ination, the coe¢ cient on the lagged ination is still negative, thereby we can conclude that the forward-looking Phillips curve is able to adequately account for the persistence of ination deviations from the steady state, and that lagged ination is not important for this persistence.
In the numerical assessment, I parameterize the hazard function with a functional form motivated from the Weibull duration model. By de...nition, it is a function with two parameters. One parameter is the scale parameter, which controls the average duration of the price adjustment. The other is the shape parameter that determines the monotonic property of the hazard function. By changing the value of the shape parameter, this hazard function enables the incorporation of a wide range of hazard pro...les. When simulating the full-scale general equilibrium model, I combine the generalized NKPC with a simple aggregate demand curve and an exogenous nominal money growth process. The simulation results show that the increasing-hazard model generates hump-shaped impulse responses of ination and real output to the nominal money growth shock. Moreover, impulse responses of output lead those of ination, which reects a robust feature of the data.
This paper relates to a number of existing studies. While Mankiw and Reis (2002) also emphasize the role of lagged expectations in propagating shocks through the sticky information assumption, this model ...nds that a similar mechanism can be motivated within the timedependent pricing paradigm. Mash (2004) constructs a mixture of the Calvo and Taylor pricing models and shows that the NKPC under increasing hazard functions replicates a large part of persistence in ination and in the output gap. Parallel to my methodology, Costain and Nákov (2008) parameterize a hazard function in a state-dependent pricing context. The most closely related paper in the literature is Sheedy (2007), who parameterizes the hazard function in such a way that the resulting NKPC has a positive coe¢ cient on lagged ination given that the hazard function is upward sloping. This result, however, is only valid under his hazard function speci...cation.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 1, I introduce the model with generalized time-dependent pricing at the ...rm's level and derive the New Keynesian Phillips curve; section 2 shows some analytical results to give the structural interpretation of the coe¢ cients of the generalized NKPC; in section 3, I introduce the calibration strategy of the model's parameters and present the simulation results; section 4 contains some concluding remarks.
2 The model
In this section, I introduce the generalized time-dependent model of nominal rigidity à la Wolman (1999). The most important components of the model are 1) monopolistic competitive ...rms who set their prices according to the demand condition and the probabilities for re-optimizing their prices, and 2) ...rms cannot adjust their price whenever they want, instead, the opportunities for re-adjusting their prices depend on exogenous hazard rates, which are based on the length of
3

time since the last adjustment.

2.1 Monopolistic competition ...rms

I consider an economy with a continuum of monopolistic competitive ...rms which are di¤erentiated with respect to the type of worker they use, indexed by i 2 f0; 1g. The ...nal goods sector is perfectly competitive and produces a single ...nal good, Yt, with all intermediate goods using a CES aggregate production function (Dixit and Stiglitz, 1977)

Yt =

Z1 1 Yi;t di

;

(1)

Given this aggregate production function and the market structure, the pro...t maximization problem of the ...nal-good ...rm solves the demand function for intermediate goods,

Yid;t =

Pi;t Pt

Yt;

(2)

Where Pi;t denotes the nominal price of good i, and Pt is the aggregate price for one unit of the ...nal good Yt. It follows that the welfare-based aggregate price index is obtained by the following expression:

Pt =

Z1 Pi1;t

di

2.2 The generalized time-dependent pricing
The principal assumption of the model is that ...rms cannot adjust their price whenever they want. Instead, opportunities for re-optimizing their prices depend on exogenous probabilities which are related to the length of time since the last adjustment. I summarize this limited price adjustment scheme using an arbitrary hazard function hj, where j denotes the period of time elapsed since the last price adjustment j 2 f0; Jg. Because it is di¢ cult to justify that some ...rms keep their prices constant forever, I assume there is a maximum number of periods in which a ...rm can ...x its price (J). Firms in the same vintage ( j ) have the same probability (hj) of adjusting their prices. Note that, for the basic model, I do not parameterize the hazard function, so that the relative magnitudes of the hazard rates are totally free. By doing that, the analytical results derived from the model should be robust to any shape of the hazard function.

2.2.1 Dynamics of the vintage distribution

To aggregate the economy, we need to track the distribution of ...rms'vintages. At the end of

each period, those ...rms that reoptimize their prices in the current period are labelled by the

`vintage 0', while the other ...rms move to the next vintage j + 1 because their prices age by one-

period. Assume that the ex ante distribution of price vintages is t = f t(0); t(2)

then, after ...rms re-optimize their prices, the ex post distribution

0 t

=

is obtained by

When period t is over, this ex post distribution

0 t

becomes

an

distribution

for

the new period t+1: Table (??) summarizes key notations concerning the dynamics of vintage

distribution.

Table ?? is about here

2.2.2 The stationary distribution

As long as the hazard rates are well de...ned, dynamics of the vintage distribution can be viewed

as a Markov process with an invariant distribution

, obtained by solving

t(j) =

0 t

(j

1) =

t+1(j): It yields the stationary vintage distribution (j) as follows:

(j) = i=0

J 1n

J1

n=0i=0 i

n=0Sn

J1

(5)

Let's assume the economy converges to this invariant distribution fairly quickly, so that

regardless of the initial vintage distribution, I only consider the economy with the above invariant

distribution of vintages. For any stationary distribution (j), the aggregate price index (3) can

be rewritten as a distributed sum of all vintage prices, reecting the fact that all ...rms setting

prices in the same period should choose the same price, assuming no other heterogeneity a¤ects

the ...rms'price decisions.

The optimal price is de...ned as Pt j, set j periods ago. It allows for the aggregate price index to be obtained by the weighted sum of the past optimal prices as follows:

0 JX1
Pt = @
j=0

2.2.3 Optimal pricing

In a given period when a ...rm is allowed to reoptimize its price, the optimal price chosen should

reect the possibility that it will not be adjusted in the near future. Consequently, adjusting

...rms choose an optimal price that maximizes the discounted sum of real pro...ts over the time

horizon during which the new price is expected to hold. The probability that the new price is

...xed is given by the survival function S(j) de...ned in Table (??). The maximization problem is

obtained by

max
Pt

JX1 Sj EtfQt;t+j [Ytd+jjt
j=0

T Ct+j =Pt+j ]g

Where Et denotes the conditional expectation operator based on the information set at period t, and Qt;t+j is the stochastic discount factor which is appropriate for discounting real

5

pro...ts from time t + j to time t. Ytd+jjt denotes real output demand in period t + j for a ...rm that resets its price in period t. I implicitly assume here that ...rms have no monopolistic power
in individual labor markets, so that ...rms do not consider the possibility of their price decisions a¤ecting future real wages and hence future marginal costs2. As a result, the optimal price has
no direct e¤ect on the future cost.
Firms maximize pro...ts subject to two constraints. The ...rst is the production function

Yt = ZtNt

(7)

where Zt denotes productivity which is identical across sectors. Log deviation of productivity

z^t follows an exogenous stochastic process (z^t = zz^t 1 + "z;t), where "z;t is white noise and z 2 [0; 1). Ytd+jjt denotes demand of real output in period t + j for a ...rm that resets its price
in period t, which follows:

Ytd+jjt =

Pt Pt+j

Yt+j ;

The parameter can be interpreted as the elasticity of substitution among intermediate

goods.

This optimization yields the following ...rst order necessary condition:

Pt =

JP1 Sj Et[Qt;t+j Yt+j Pt+j1M Ct+j ]
j=0
1 JP1 Sj Et[Qt;t+j Yt+j Pt+j1]
j=0

(8)

Where M Ct+j denotes nominal marginal cost. One can see that the optimal price is equal to the markup multiplied by the weighted sum of future nominal marginal costs. The weight depends on the survival rate. In addition, the maximum time horizon J depends on the speed at which the survival function goes to zero. In the Calvo case, where S(j) = (1 ) j, survival rates approach zero as j increases, but never reach, thereby making the decision horizon in...nite in this case.

2.3 Steady State
Before starting to derive the NKPC in terms of log deviations from the steady state, I de...ne it as follows: in the steady state, all real variables are constant, while, all nominal variables and the price level grows at a constant rate of trend ination, which is equal to the growth rate of nominal money stock set by the central bank g = . If we de...ne X as the steady state value of variable X, then the optimality condition (8) can be rewritten as:
2 Here I assume the ...rm type is not the same as the labor type, thereby, in each labor market, all intermediate ...rms demand some labor from it. As a result, Iabor markets are competitive, and there is no di¤erence between real wages among individual ...rms. See Woodford (2003).

(9)

From Equation (9), we see that, at the steady state, the relative price

r

=

pt Pt

is a constant,

equal to the product of a constant markup, real marginal cost and an extra term, which sum-

marizes the e¤ect of trend ination on the relative price. When trend ination is zero (g = 1),

then this term is equal to one, allowing this equation to reduce to the static pricing equation,

which expresses the optimal price as the nominal marginal cost multiplied by a constant markup

( 1 ). When the trend ination is greater than zero (g > 1), however, the bracketed term is greater than one, so is the relative price, meaning that the optimal price is adjusted at a higher

rate than the trend ination. The economic intuition is that forward-looking price setters take

into account that trend ination erodes their relative prices over time, so that they need to

`front-load' the price when they reoptimize it. Consequently, this higher relative price ratio

leads to lower steady state output and hence induces an additional welfare loss caused by the

positive trend ination.

2.4 New Keynesian Phillips curve

To derive the NKPC, I ...rst log-linearize equations (6) and (8) around the zero-ination steady

state. De...ning x^t = logXt logX:, I obtain following log-linearized equations:

23

p^t

where

JX1 = j Sj

j=0 j=0

(10)

JX1

p^t =

(k) p^t k;

k=0

(11)

After some tedious algebra, I obtain the generalized NKPC from Equation (10) and (11)3. To reveal the essential implications of the NKPC for the ination dynamics, I derive it without trend ination, i.e. g = 1.

3 Log-linearization of price equations and the detailed derivation of NKPC can be found in a technical Appendix, available upon request from the author.

At ...rst sight, this New Keynesian Phillips curve has a much more complex structure than

the Calvo NKPC. It involves not only lagged ination but also lagged expectations that were

built into pricing decisions in the past. All coe¢ cients in the NKPC are derived from deep

parameters which represent either stationary distributional parameters or the preference para-

meter.

In this example, current ination depends on marginal costs, lagged ination and a complex

weighted sum of expectations. All coe¢ cients are expressed in terms of non-adjustment rates

( j = 1 hj) and the subjective discount factor : It is natural to ask why these lagged terms are absent in the Calvo NKPC. Are there new

insights of the NKPC that can be gained by relaxing the constant hazard assumption? The

answer is yes. In the next section, I use a proposition to elaborate this point formally.

3 Analytical results

3.1 New insights of the generalized NKPC:

Proposition 1 When assuming the hazard rates are constant w.r.t. time-since-last-adjustment, the generalized NKPC (12) reduces to the standard Calvo New Keynesian Phillips curve.

These equations reveal why the lagged ination and lagged expectations are missing in the Calvo NKPC. Given the constant hazard function, the e¤ects of lagged ination exactly cancel out the e¤ects of lagged expectations, leaving only current variables and forward-looking expectations in the NKPC. In the more general case, however, both lagged ination and ination expectations should be present in the Phillips curve.
In addition, given any values between zero and one for non-adjustment rates ( j), coe¢ cients of the lagged inations are always negative, while coe¢ cients of lagged expectations are always positive. The reason why lagged ination and lagged expectations exert opposite e¤ects on the current ination is the following: on the one hand, because the price is sticky, expectations have a long lasting inuence on the economy. The higher the expectations of marginal costs, the higher is the ination; on the other hand, past ination has a negative impact on current ination due to the "front-loading" e¤ect. Again, because prices are sticky, ...rms adjust more than necessary to hedge against the risk that they might not be allowed to re-optimize again in the near future and would be unwilling to react to a current economic condition. The `frontloading'pricing therefore deters the price adjustment needed in the future. Due to this e¤ect, a high level of past ination hinders the ability of current ination to continue to be high. In the more general setting, both e¤ects work against each other, but in the Calvo model, these two e¤ects just cancel each other out.

3.2 The role of lagged ination:
The next question that I can address by using the generalized NKPC is whether the ination persistence is `intrinsic 'in this model, de...ned as ination driven by its own lags with positive coe¢ cients.
To answer this question, we need to identify the sign of the coe¢ cient on lagged ination, while taking the e¤ects of lagged expectations into account. To do it, I substitute lagged expectations of ination from the Phillips curve with expectational errors by using the following identities:

9

Et 1 [^t+1] Et [^t+1] + Et [^t+1] Et 2 [^t] Et 1 [^t] + Et 1 [^t] Et 1 [^t] ^t + ^t Et 2 [^t 1] ^t 1 + ^t 1

= = = =

t + Et [^t+1] t 1 + Et 1 [^t] t + ^t t 1 + ^t 1

Where t and t are white noises under rational expectations. Again, when J = 3, I obtain the following compact form of the NKPC:

^t =

2
1+ 2+

^t 1 + 1Et [^t+1] + 2Et [^t+2] + 3Ft [mcc] + 3!t

2 = 1+

2
2+

;
12

3=

1+

1 + 2 1 2 (1 + 1+ 2+ 1 2

2)

Where Ft [mcc] summarizes all expectational terms of marginal cost and !t is a linear combination of white noise expectational errors under rational expectations. Given any well-de...ned

hazard rate, the alphas lie between zero and one, and the coe¢ cient on ^t 1 is always negative. Since a negative coe¢ cient works against ination persistence, this theory does not provide

support for intrinsic persistence. Instead, persistence should come from the additional movingaverage terms of real shocks through the presence of the lagged expectations4. This result is

consistent with empirical evidence shown by Cogley and Sbordone (2006) and Bils et al. (2009),

that the purely forward-looking model explains the persistence of the ination deviation from

its trend quite well when applied to the correctly detrended ination data. Based on these

results, we can conclude that the forward-looking Phillips curve is able to adequately account

for the persistence of ination deviations from the steady state, and that lagged ination is not

important for this persistence.

4 Numerical experiment
To study the e¤ects of varying shapes of the hazard function on the dynamics of ination and output gap, I close the model by adding a simple aggregate demand condition and a nominal money growth rule to the NKPC.

m^ t = y^t mcct = 1y^t 2z^t m^ t = m^ t 1 ^t + gt
z^t = z z^t 1 + t gt = m gt 1 + ut

(15) (16) (17) (18) (19)

Equation (15) represents a simple money-market equilibrium condition, where m^ t is the log deviation of the real money balance from the steady state. This equation can be motivated

4 In principle, this result can be extended to the NKPC with an arbitrary length of J.

through the quantity theory of money.with a constant velocity. is the income elasticity of money demand. Equation (16) de...nes the real marginal cost as a linear function of real output gap and the technology shock. 1 and 2 are positive coe¢ cients, which measure the degree of real rigidity (Ball and Romer, 1990). Equation (17) is a nominal money growth rule, where gt denotes the exogeneous growth rate of the nominal money stock. For both shocks (z^t; gt), I assume that they are following AR(1) processes with i.i.d. innovations.

4.1 Calibration

In calibration, I use a novel strategy for parameterizing the hazard function. Since the hazard function in this model is de...ned in terms of the time-since-last-adjustment, it is reasonable to base its calibration on the well-established statistical theory of duration analysis. In particular, the functional form I apply is based on the Weibull distribution with two parameters5.

j1 h(j) =

(20)

is the scale parameter, which controls the average duration of the price adjustment, while is the shape parameter to determine the monotonic property of the hazard function. It enables the incorporation of a wide range of hazard functions by using various values of the shape parameter. In fact, any value of the shape parameter that is greater than one corresponds to an increasing hazard function, while values ranging between zero and one lead to a decreasing hazard function. By setting the shape parameter to one, we can retrieve the Poisson process from the Weibull distribution. In the ...gure (1), I give some examples of hazard functions and the corresponding Weibull distributions with varing values of the shape parameter.
Figure 1 about here
To calibrate the Weibull parameters, I choose the shape parameter in the range between 1 and 2. Even though this range only covers increasing hazard functions, it is more theoretically justi...ed, because it makes the maximum number of price duration J ...nite. Furthermore, I set
= 4:5, so that it implies an average non-adjustment rate equal to 0.75, a value commonly used for the Calvo model. In the calibration of the preference parameters, I assume = 0:9902, which implies a steady state real return on ...nancial assets of about four percent per annum. I also choose = 10, which implies the markup is around 11%. Following Mankiw and Reis (2002), I choose income elasticity of money demand = 0:5. Finally, I set 1 = 2 = 0:15, implying a mild degree of 'real rigidity'.

4.2 Impulse responses
To evaluate the quantitative performance of the model, I apply the standard algorithm to solve for the log-linearized rational expectation model6 and report the impulse responses of ination and output gap.
5 In Appendix(B), I give an introduction to the Weibull distribution. 6 I am grateful to Alexander Meyer-Gohde for helping me to calculate the equilibrium with some extreme parameter values, where the computation involves large numbers of lags and leads of expectations. For the details of the algorithm, you can refer to Meyer-Gohde (2007).

Figure 2 illustrates impulse responses of ination and output to a transitory 1% increase in the annual nominal money growth rate ( m = 0). While, in the Calvo setup, the response of ination jump on impact and decays monotonically afterwards, it is hump-shaped in the increasing-hazard setting and peaks at around third quarters.
Figure 2 about here
Figure 3 depicts responses to a persistent money growth shock ( m = 0:95). When shocks are persistent, both ination and output responses are hump-shaped. It also exhibits that output leads ination, a rather robust feature of the data. Under Calvo, however, either ination and output have their largest correlation contemporaneously (non-persistent shock) or ination leads output (persistent shock).
Figure 3 about here
The economic intuition behind these results is that, on the one hand, only a few ...rms adjust their prices immediately after a shock, and more and more adjust later on, thereby postponing the timing of the adjustment. On the other hand, the size of the adjustment is increasing in the time since the shock occurred. The later a ...rm changes its price, the larger the adjustment it needs to make. In another words, the increasing-hazard pricing a¤ects not only the timing of the price adjustment, but also the average magnitude of ...rms'adjustments, in that they tend to increase some periods after the shock, leading to a hump-shaped response.
Conclusion
The central theme of this study is to show non-constant hazard functions induced by the pricing assumption implies di¤erent aggregate dynamics. I derive a general New Keynesian Phillips curve, reecting an arbitrary hazard function. The generalized NKPC involves components including lagged ination, forward-looking and lagged expectations of inations and real marginal cost, which nests the standard Calvo Phillips curve as a limiting case.
While the standing theory of the Phillips curve has argued that, in order to generate ination persistence in the data, the NKPC needs to incorporate the lagged ination with a signi...cant positive coe¢ cient, which is interpreted as `intrinsic ination persistence', I however, show that this is not the case in the general time-dependent pricing model. It accounts for ination persistence not because of the `intrinsic' force, but due to the moving-average precess of real shocks through the presence of lagged expectations. Therefore including lagged expectations is important for the ination dynamics.
In the numerical exercise, I contribute to the literature with a new approach to parameterize the hazard function by using the Weibull distribution. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows for exible characteristics in the hazard function, which in turn provides an alternative discipline to calibrate the parameters of the distribution of price vintages. More importantly, this parsimonious approach makes the underlying mechanism transparent. The numerical results show that the increasing hazard function leads to hump-shaped impulse responses of ination to monetary shocks, and output leads ination.

Given that handling a more sophisticated pricing model-such as the state-dependent pricing model-is rather challenging, the model presented here is a promising candidate for monetary policy research, in that it compromises of a better modeling of the pricing mechanism and tractability of the model's solution required for policy analysis.

A Proof for Proposition 1

In the Calvo pricing case, all hazards are equal to a constant between zero and one. Let's denote the constant hazard as h = 1 . We can rearrange the NKPC 12 in the following way:

X1

^t +

k ^t k = (1

X1 ) kEt k (1

X1 X1 ! ) i imct+i k + i i ^t+i k

k=1
^t + ^t 1 + 2^t 2 +

k=0
= Et (1 )(1

i=0
X1 ) i imct+i + (1

i=0

i=0
X1 ) i imct+i 2 + (1

i=0
X1

!

) i i ^t+i 2

i=0 i=0

... (21)

Then iterating this equation one period forwards,

^t+1 + ^t + 2 ^t 1 + 3 ^t 2

= Et+1 (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i+1 + (1

! X1 ) i i ^t+i+1

+ Et (1 )(1

+ 2Et 1 (1 )(1 ) i imct+i 1 + (1 ) i i ^t+i 1

i=0 i=0

...

Then substitute Equation 21 for the term in the brackets on the left hand side of this equation,

14

^t+1 + Et (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i + (1

! X1 ) i i ^t+i

i=0 ! X1 ) i i ^t+i 2

i=0 i=0

= Et+1 (1 )(1

... X1 ) i imct+i+1 + (1

X1 ! ) i i ^t+i+1

+ Et (1 )(1

i=0
X1 ) i imct+i + (1

i=0 ! X1 ) i i ^t+i

+ 2Et 1 (1 )(1

i=0
X1 ) i imct+i 1 + (1

i=0
X1

!

) i i ^t+i 1

i=0 i=0

...

After canceling out equaling terms from both sides of the equation, we obtain the following

equation:

^t+1 = Et+1 (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i+1 + (1
i=0

! X1 ) i i ^t+i+1
i=0

Lagging this equation and rearranging it yields the familiar NKPC of the Calvo model.

^t = Et (1 )(1

X1 ) i imct+i + (1

! X1 ) i i ^t+i

i=0 i=0

^t = (1 )(1

)mct + (1 )^t + Et (^t+1)

(1 )(1 ^t =

) mct + Et (^t+1)

B The Weibull distribution

The PDF of Weibull distribution is given by the following expression:

j1

P r(j) =

exp

j

and the cumulative probability function is: F (j) = 1 exp

j

The parameters that characterize the Weibull distribution are the scale parameter and the shape parameter . The shape parameter determines the shape of the Weibull's pdf function, e.g. when = 1, it reduces to an exponential case; while with = 3:4, the Weibull amounts to the normal distribution. The scale parameter de...nes the characteristic life of the random process that amounts to the time at which 63.2% of the ...rms adjust their labor. This can be seen with the evaluation of the cdf function of the Weibull distribution at j equaling the scale parameter . Then we have, F ( ) = 1 e( 1) = 0:632.
Note that it relates to the mean duration j according to the following equation:
j = 1 = ( 1 + 1);
where () is the Gamma function. It follows that the hazard function of Weibull distribution is:
j1 h(j) =

Note that this hazard is constant when the shape parameter equals one, and increasing when is greater than one.
