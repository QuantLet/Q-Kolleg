Cancropyieldriskbegloballydiversified?*
X.L. Liua, W. Xua and M. Odeninga,c
Abstract In 2007 and 2008 world food markets observed a significant price boom. Crop failures simultaneously occurring in some of the world's major production regions have been quoted as one factor among others for the price boom. Against this background, we analyse the stochasticity of crop yields in major production areas. The analysis is exemplified for wheat, which is one of the most important crops worldwide. Particular attention is given to the stochastic dependence of yields in different regions. Thereby we address the question of whether local fluctuations of yields can be smoothed by international agricultural trade, i.e. by global diversification. The analysis is based on the copula approach, which requires less restrictive assumptions compared with linear correlations. The use of copulas allows for a more reliable estimation of extreme yield shortfalls, which are of particular interest in this application. Our calculations reveal that a production shortfall, such as in 2007, is not a once in a lifetime event. Instead, from a statistical point of view, similar production conditions will occur every 15 years.

I Introduction
Agricultural commodity markets have been regulated for a long time by a variety of instruments, including intervention prices, fixed and variable tariffs, export subsidies and production quotas. Due to negotiations within the WTO, most agricultural markets have been deregulated during the last two decades throughout the world. This abolishment of price stabilizing measures led to an increase in price volatility on formerly regulated markets (Yang et al., 2001; Chavas and Kim, 2006). Although higher price fluctuations were expected, the crop price boom in 2007/2008 surprised market experts. This rise of agricultural commodity prices can be regarded from two perspectives. On the one hand, it quickened optimism in the agribusiness. For example, the end of the technological treadmill, which prevented an increase of farm incomes in the past, was proclaimed (von Witzke et al., 2008). On the other hand, the sharp increase of food prices shortened the food supply in low income countries and aggravated hunger and malnutrition among poor people. From a scientific point of view, two questions arise: what factors were responsible for the price boom and how likely is it that a similar constellation of price determining factors will occur again? It is widely accepted that multiple factors caused the recent increase in agricultural commodity prices. Sarris (2009) emphasizes three main factors: first, crop failures simultaneously occurred in major production region of the world; second, there was an increased demand for biofuels; and third, investors in agricultural commodity markets were involved in speculative activities. This article focuses on the first of these factors, i.e. stochastic shifts on the supply side. It is well known that agricultural yields, crop yields in particular, heavily depend on weather conditions. Thus, weather risks are immediately reflected in yield risks (e.g. Odening et al., 2008; Musshoff et al., 2009). When analysing the impact of yield fluctuations on agricultural prices, the choice of an appropriate perspective is important. For example, a regional analysis is not appropriate because poor harvests in one country can be compensated by imports (Lotze-Campen, 2007). In integrated markets, diversification by global trade has to be taken into account and thus a global analysis of agricultural yield risks is necessary. Against this background, we analyse the stochasticity of crop yields in the world's major production areas. The analysis is exemplified for wheat, which is one of the most important crops in the world in terms of production area and food security. Particular attention is given to the stochastic dependence of yields in different parts of the world. The spatial dependence structure is modelled using copulas. Compared with linear correlations, the application of copulas requires less restrictive assumptions and has advantages in the estimation of the joint occurrence of extreme events (c.f. Embrechts et al., 1999). Copulas became increasingly popular in the last decade and have been applied to various finance and insurance problems (Cherubini et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2009; Turgutlu and Ucer, 2010). Bianchi et al. (2009) integrated a copula approach in the Vector-Auto-Regression model (VAR) to model and forecast the dynamics of industrial production in the euro-zone. Applications in agricultural economics, however, are rare. Vedenov (2008) analyses the relationship between individual farm
1

yields and area yields and Zhu et al. (2008) investigate the dependence of prices and yields in the context of revenue insurance. The remainder of the article is divided into two main sections. Section II describes the methodological approach. We briefly review the concept of the copula and present the idea of a fully nested Archimedian copula for modelling high dimensional dependence structures. This concept is then applied to the estimation of joint yield risks of major wheat producers. Data and estimation results are presented in section III. The article ends with conclusions on the systemic risk of wheat production and the effectiveness of global trade to diversify this risk.

II Modelling Stochastic Dependence using Copulas

Theoretical framework

The outcome of multi-dimensional risks can be presented by using a multivariate
distribution F x1,, xd  , in which xi denotes the realization of the random variable
X i , i  1,, d . Direct estimation of the joint distribution F usually fails due to

insufficient data. Alternatively, the joint distribution F can be determined by linking
the univariate marginal distribution Fi xi  by means of the (linear) correlation

coefficients between random variables. Yet, such kind of estimation of the joint

distribution F is valid only for the family of elliptical multivariate distribution

including multivariate normal distribution (cf. Embrechts et al., 2002). If this

assumption does not hold then the associated (linear) correlation coefficients are not

able to capture the complete information about the dependence structure between

each single risk involved ­ particularly for the tail dependence, which plays an

important role for the analysis of extreme events. Xu et al. (2010) showed with an

example of weather risk how large the estimation error can be if linear correlation

were applied instead of a more appropriate and sophisticated model.

The theoretical fundament of the copula concept is given by Sklar's Theorem (Sklar,
1959), which states that any d -dimensional distribution F x1,, xd  can be
described by using a copula function C() :

F (x1,, xd ) = C{F1 (x1 ),, Fd (xd )},  x1,, xd  R

(1)

Fi (xi ) denotes the (univariate) marginal distribution and ui  Fi xi   0,1 is

therefore the uniform marginal distribution. Following Joe (1997), the copula

function can be understood as a multivariate distribution function with all margins being uniformly distributed on [0,1]:

C(u1,, ud

=

F{F 1 1

(u1

),



,

F

1
d

(u

)},

F i

(2)

Equation 1 allows us to decompose any d -dimensional joint distribution function
F (x1,, xd ) into its d marginal distributions F1 (x1 ),, Fd (xd ) , and a copula C,

which describes the dependence structure among the d random variables. As with

the estimation of any distribution function one can apply either parametric or

nonparametric (e.g. kernel) approaches (Chen and Huang, 2007). Vedenov (2008)

argues that a nonparametric copula is a natural choice since there is no constructive

way to determine the optimal copula function and thus the danger of misspecifying

2

the copula is high. On the other hand, if valuable prior information is available,

parametric methods can improve the estimation results (Charpentier et al., 2007;

Genest et al., 1995). The main reason for using a parametric approach in this study is its superiority in simulating data from the copula. In fact, up to now there is no efficient method on simulation from the multivariate empirical distributions.

Parametric copulas can be classified into elliptical and Archimedean copulas. In the

following, we concentrate only on Archimedean copulas, which can be described in a

closed form. This property is convenient when applying simulation procedures. The

general expression of Archimedean copulas is given by:

Cu1,,ud    1 (u1 )    (ud )

(3)

where  is called the generator function with (0) = 1 , () = 0 and  1 is its

inverse. The family of Archimedean copulas includes three important types: the

Gumbel, the Clayton and the Frank. The Gumbel copula is asymmetric and

appropriate for presenting upper tail dependence which shows a stronger linkage between positive values, more variability and more mass in the positive tail than, for example, the Gaussian copula (Okhrin, 2007). In contrast to the Gumbel copula, the

Clayton copula assigns a higher probability to joint extreme negative events than to

joint extreme positive events. It displays lower tail dependence and is characterized by zero upper tail dependence (Nelsen, 2006, p. 215). Because of this feature, the Clayton copula has been widely used in financial applications and risk management

(e.g., Junker and May, 2005; Blum et al., 2002). The Frank copula is adequate to

model symmetric dependence structures and exhibits both positive and negative dependence. In contrast to the Gumbel and the Clayton copula, the Frank copula implies tail independence (Nelsen, 2006, p. 215).

Hierarchical construction of a multi-dimensional dependence structure

Although the approach described above provides a relatively easy method to estimate and simulate the high-dimensional dependence structure, it is in fact extremely restrictive in the practical application of modelling a higher-dimensional case. The reason is that most multivariate Archimedean copula models present the whole dependence structure with only one single copula parameter  , independent of the dimension of the model. Consequently, the substructure of the dependence is invisible. Furthermore, a multivariate Archimedean copula implicitly assumes that the order of margins ui within the copula function is exchangeable. For instance, for
a three dimensional case this means Cu1,u2 ,u3   Cu3 ,u1,u2  . However, the
implied permutation symmetry of the copula represents a very specialized dependence structure, which is not plausible for many applications (cf. McNeil et al., 2005, p. 224; Savu and Trede, 2010). In view of these shortcomings, attempts have been made to develop a more flexible and appropriate Archimedean model for capturing a high-dimensional dependence structure. One convincing method is the so-called Fully-Nested Archimedian Copulas (FNAC), which aggregates one dimension step by step starting from a low dimensional copula (Savu and Trede, 2010). The model for the d -dimensional dependence structure using the FNAC approach can be expressed as:

capture the joint distribution of each aggregation step from low dimension (low level) to high dimension (high level). The symbol ,,  " is the composition operator.

The FNAC method (Equation 4) is therefore characterized by up to d 1 copulas

composed of d (d  1) / 2 possible combinations of distinct bivariate marginal
  distributions Fi xi , Fj x j with i  j . The substructures of multidimensional

are

expressed

hierarchically

(see

Fig.

in

Section

III).

The construction of the multivariate dependence structure can be carried out with

following steps: Initially at the lowest level, two variables with the largest copula parameter  among all of the d (d  1) / 2 pairs of variables will be combined by

using a bivariate Archimedean copula. The first combination at the lowest level (two-

dimensional dependence structure) can be described as:

z1



C1 u1, u2





 1 1

u1

(5)

On the second level (three-dimensional dependence structure), the joint distribution

z1 with u3 is nested by using C2 z1,u3  :

(6)

This procedure will be repeated until the highest level has been reached. Since

Equation 4 involves d 1 generator functions, there are total d 1 copula

parameters to be estimated (in contrast to Equation 3).

Usually, all bivariate combinations within a FACN structure employ the same copula

type, so that the copula models differ only in the copula parameters. These

parameters must be strictly monotone decreasing from the lowest level to the highest level, 1  2    d1 . This condition, together with the use of the same copula

type, ensures that the outcome of the combination of two copulas from different

levels results again in a proper copula (Joe, 1997; Embrechts et al., 2003).

Estimation and Goodness-of-Fit tests of copulas

In general, three approaches are available to estimate the parameters of a copula (cf.

Cherubini et al., 2004). The Exact Maximum Likelihood Method (EMLM) estimates the copula parameter  and the parameters of the marginal distributions 1,, d

simultaneously. Alternatively, a two-step procedure can be used, where the

parameters of the margins  are estimated first. Afterwards the copula parameters

are determined, e.g. by maximum likelihood, treating the parameters of the margins

as given. This procedure is called the inference for margin (IFM) method (Joe 1997).

The IFM method is less efficient than the one-step maximum likelihood but

computationally more attractive. An alternative semi-parametric estimation

procedure is the Canonical Maximum-Likelihood (CML) (Haerdle et al., 2008). The

log-likelihood function is given by:

    k
^ = argmax ln[c{F^1 x1 j ,, F^d xdj ;}]  j=1

(7)

4

 F^ xij is the i -th empirical marginal distribution based on the observations xij ,
j  1,, k . ^ is also called as Maximum-Pseudo-Likelihood-Estimator or rank-

based Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator. The difference between CML and the two previously introduced methods, EMLM and IFM, is that the parametric marginal

distribution is substituted by the empirical (rank-based) marginal distribution

(Equation 10). The CML method is quite useful if the precise estimation of parametric margins is hampered by a limited number of observations. The CML

method will be applied to the estimation of the copula parameter in this study.

Since different copula models imply very different dependence structures, it is important to apply the correct one that fits the empirical data the best. Although the

underlying test problem is analogous to a Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) test for univariate

distributions, it is more difficult applied to multidimensional distributions. In this context, Genest and Remillard (2008) propose a GoF-test belonging to the class of the dimension reduction approaches. Let C be the true d -dimensional copula for the empirical data, which is to be modelled and let C be the underlying copula candidate to be tested. The subscript  is the associated copula parameter. The

testing hypothesis can be expressed as:
H 0 : C  C = C ;  vs. H1 : C  C = C ;  

(8)

where  is the space of copula parameter. The GoF-test for Equation 8 is based on

the Cramer-von-Mises Statistic T^ , which measures the distance between empirical

copula C^  and the candidate of parametric copula C () .

    T^ = k  [0,1]d C^ (Z )  C (Z ) 2 dC^ (z) = k C^ (Z j )  C (Z j ) 2 j =1

(9)

Herein, Z denotes the d -dimensional empirical marginal distribution which can be

described as

(10)

where k is the number of observations and Rij is the rank of the observations xij

amongst ( x11 ,..., xdk ), i  (1,, d ) . The elements of Z are called pseudo-

The empirical copula C^ can then be expressed as

where I () is an indicator function and u1,,ud  are order statistics from the

which the calculation of Equation 9 is repeated for L times. The p -value for

Equation 9 can be calculated by using the following expression:

Copula-based simulation of simultaneous risks

Once the marginal distributions and the copula have been determined and estimated

parametrically, the realization of d -dimensional random variables, which follow the
joint distribution F x1,, xd  can be generated by employing the Monte-Carlo

simulation method. In the context of multi-dimensional copulas, the ,,conditional

inverse method" has been employed (Haerdle and Okhrin, 2009). The basic idea of

this method is to generate the multi-dimensional random variables recursively

according to the associated conditional distribution. First, the d -dimensional
independent variables v1,, vd are drawn from the uniform distribution U  0,1.
Afterwards the d -dimensional uniform-distributed variables u1,,ud will be
generated. In contrast to the generation of v1,, vd , the d -dimensional variables
u1,,ud are stochastic dependent. The dependence structure of u1,,ud is captured
by the copulas Cu1,, ud  . To achieve this, a recursive procedure is carried out. In
the first step, the initial value of u1 is equal to v1 . The consecutive values u2 ,,ud

can be determined by the following procedure:

ui  1 vi , i  2,, d

(14)

The relationship between ui and vi can be determined by a certain function  and

through the inverse function of  the independent uniform-distributed multivariate

variables v1,, vd will be transformed to the dependent uniform-distributed
multivariate variables u1,,ud . Therefore, the function  also describes the dependence structure of u1,,ud .  can be defined as:
    ui u1,, ui1  P U i  ui U1  u1,,U i1  ui1

    i1Ci u1,, ui

 i1Ci1 u1 ,, ui1

(15)

u1,, ui1

u1,, ui1

Ci  stands for the copula with i -th dimensional margins. In the last step, the

realizations xi associated with each random variable X i can be generated by using

 xi  Fi1 ui , i  1,, d

(16)

where  Fi1 ui is the inverse function of the marginal distribution Fi xi  . The

resulting realizations x1,, xd , which are simulated by using the above-mentioned

6

procedure, follow the joint distribution F x1,, xd  , or more precisely they follow the copula Cu1,,ud .

III Empirical Analysis of Shortfall Risk on Global Crop Production

Data and modelling procedure

The empirical analysis is based on the yield data of wheat for the main producing

countries worldwide. To limit computational work, the eight most important

countries are selected: Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Pakistan, Turkey and the USA1. In 2007, the amount of the wheat production in these countries share 58%

of the total production worldwide. The empirical data of wheat yields for these

countries is provided by FAO (http://faostat.fao.org) and is available from 1961 to

2007, comprising of 47 observations. The empirical analysis involves the following

steps: First, the total amount of wheat yield is converted into per hectare yields.

Using the hectare yields makes it easier to compare countries with different

production scales. Moreover, changes of the acreage from year to year will not affect the analysis2. Second, to eliminate the production trend caused by technical progress,

the hectare yields are detrended by applying the following linear model: yi,t  mi   i  t   i , i  1,,8

(17)

where yi,t is the hectare yield (dt/hectare), mi the constant term for country i , t

denotes time and i captures technical progress. The residual  i is the detrended

hectare yield.

Table A1 in the appendix shows the detrended hectare  yields for eight countries in

ascending order. Note that yields realized in 2007 were the third worst yields since

1961 in four countries; however, this yield did not affect all eight countries. For

example, in Pakistan a relatively good harvest was recorded in 2007. Furthermore,

the figures provide an impression about the size of the yield volatility as well as their

differences in each of the observed countries for each year. Using the detrended yield data  i in Equation 17, univariate yield distributions are

specified and estimated for each wheat producing country. The type of yield

distribution is selected according to a  2 -test. A hierarchical Archimedean copula,

FNAC, has then been estimated for the eight-dimensional detrended hectare yield,  i

as described in the previous section. Once a hierarchical dependence structure is defined, the vector  i can be simulated by using conditional inverse method (see

Equations 14 - 16). Finally, the total yield (tons) for the eight countries related to

parameters of interest can be derived.

Results

The results of the GoF-test for the marginal distributions of the detrended hectare yield,  i , are presented in Table A2 in the appendix. Apparently, the random yields
in the various countries cannot be described by only one type of distribution. Instead, the yields follow different distributions, such as Weibull, Gaussian or Lognormal distributions. Similar results are reported by Moriondo et. al., (2009) as well as Upadhyay and Smith (2005). This finding confirms that the joint yield distribution for all countries cannot be multivariate normal and hence the requirement for using linear correlations coefficients is not fulfilled. The selection of the appropriate copula type is based on the GoF-test described in the previous section. The Clayton, the Gumbel and the Franck copula have been considered as candidates. The test was conducted for all 28 possible country pairs. In most cases the Clayton copula yields the best fit and thus this copula type was chosen for the entire FNAC. This result also indicates that the use of linear correlation would be inappropriate.

Fig. 2. Fully nested hierarchical structure of the Archimedean copula, FNAC
Next, the structure of the hierarchical copula is determined. The aggregation of countries rests on the test statistic of the GoF-test. Fig. 2 depicts the resulting dependence structure (left part) and presents the test statistics for the Clayton copula (right part). The estimates of the copula parameters decrease with increasing aggregation level, which is in accordance with theoretical requirements. An exception is the estimate on level six, which might be caused by the limited database that includes only 47 observations. As expected, the yields between neighbouring countries, for example between Germany and France, show a high stochastic dependence. On the other hand, it is surprising that the stochastic dependence between India and Germany is higher than the stochastic dependence between India in Pakistan. That means that stochastic dependence is not a simple function of distance as implied by commonly used decorrelation functions. Fig. 3 and Table 1 present the main results of our analysis, namely the distribution function for per hectare yields (Fig. 3(a)) and for the total wheat production (Fig. 3(b)). Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) refer to the yield level (mean yield with trend) and acreage at the end of the observation period, i.e. 2007. The interpretation of Fig. 3(a) is rather difficult since the distribution is derived by aggregating very heterogeneous regions. Thus, is helpful to use the outcome of the extreme year 2007 as a reference point. In 2007, a per hectare yield of 33.52 decitons was realized. According to Fig. 3(a) the stochastic yields fall below this level with a probability of approximately 7%. In other words, the harvest observed in 2007 was a rare event, but statistically it will recur on average every 15 years under constant conditions.

Fig. 3. Empirical and parametric distribution functions of global wheat production
We present two alternative estimates for the distribution function of global wheat production. First, a parametric distribution, namely a Weibull distribution, has been estimated. In contrast to the copula based approach, this distribution has been directly fitted to the aggregated production data. Moreover, an empirical (nonparametric) distribution function has been estimated. Though a direct estimation
10

of the distribution function is much simpler compared to the derivation from marginals and copulas, it has some obvious flaws. First, the estimation relies on only 47 observations and thus it will be plagued by low reliability, particularly in the tails. Second, the stochastic dependence structure of the various production regions is not revealed. Finally, it is questionable if different country-specific marginal yield distributions can be correctly represented by a single parametric distribution function. In light of these drawbacks, it is not surprising that the quantiles of the three distribution functions differ. Table 1 shows that the risk of global crop failures is underestimated by the direct estimation of the univariate distribution, though the means of all three distribution functions are almost equal. For example, the 1% quantile of the Weibull distribution for per hectare yield amounts to 33.37 dt/ha which is 1.28 dt/ha higher than the copula based estimate. The corresponding value of the empirical distribution cannot be uniquely determined due to its discrete nature.

Notes: a Average yield in dt/ha. b Total production in 100 mill. tons.

To highlight the effect of global diversification of yield risk we present the results for the hypothetical scenario where yields are stochastically independent between all production regions. In this case, the distribution widens considerably and the variance increases by a factor of more than two (see Table 1 and Fig. 3). The effect of diversification is further elaborated in Fig. 4, which compares the variability of per hectare yields of different production regions. Apparently, the fluctuations of per hectare yields can be smoothed for most production regions by aggregation. This means that global trade can considerably reduce the shortfall risk for individual countries. It should be noted that a trade-off between average productivity and yield volatility exists. Intensive high tech production systems in Germany and France appears to be more sensitive to stochastic weather conditions compared to more extensive production systems in North America. Yield risk in India is similar to the global average, yet its average yields are relatively low.

IV Conclusions
The main finding of the analysis is that yield risk for wheat as an important foodstuff can be reduced by pooling and aggregating production globally. This provides an argument for international agricultural trade, which is beyond deterministic welfare gains. It has been stated that price volatility for agricultural commodities in the EU increases due to the deregulation of markets (Britz and Heckelei, 2008). It should be stressed that the increase of price risk is a result of the abolishment of price protection measures and not a result of international trade. Based on our analysis we conjecture that price volatility in the EU would be even higher without a participation in international food markets. Nevertheless, global diversification cannot completely reduce yield risks. A shortfall, such as in 2007, is not a once in a lifetime event. From a statistical point of view, similar production conditions will occur every 15 years ceteris paribus. However, a word of caution is necessary when interpreting our statistical findings. Our results do not allow for predictions about the scarcity of wheat (and hence price peaks) because the demand side was not taken into account. Clearly, the demand for wheat varies depending on population growth, income and the demand for biofuels. Furthermore, even our analysis of the supply side of the wheat market was incomplete since only eight countries were considered instead of all wheat producing countries. Moreover, the production of only a single year was analysed, ruling out time diversification. Usually food markets are short in supply if multiple poor harvests occur in a row and worldwide inventories are too small for smoothing this shortfall. This was the case in 2007/08. It should also be mentioned that our
12

probability statements refer to the yield level at the end of the observation period. An increase of the yield levels due to future technological progress has not been anticipated. Finally, one should recall that the production area depends on prices and thus is endogenous. For example, one could observe that farmers increased the acreage of wheat worldwide in 2008 as a response to the preceding price boom. Some of the aforementioned aspects could be handled in the framework of market equilibrium models. A linkage of existing market models with the presented stochastic analysis is a promising task for further research.
