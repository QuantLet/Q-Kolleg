Abstract The paper focuses on the problem of pricing and hedging a European contingent claim for an incomplete market model, in which evolution of price processes for a saving account and stocks depends on an observable Markov chain. The pricing function is evaluated using the martingale approach. The equivalent martingale measure is introduced in a way that the Markov chain remains the historical one, and the pricing function satisfies the Cauchy problem for a system of linear parabolic equations. It is shown that any European contingent claim is attainable using a generalized self-financing replicating strategy. For such a strategy, apart from the initial endowment, some additional funds are required both step-wise at the jump moments of the Markov chain and continuously between the jump moments. It is proved that the additional funds (the additional investments and consumptions) are present in the proposed strategy in a risk-neutral manner, hence the generalized selffinancing strategy is self-financing in mean. A payment for the considered option should consist of two parts: the initial endowment and a fair insurance premium in order to compensate for contributions and consumptions arising in future.

1 Introduction

Let a financial market consist of a saving account B(t) (riskless asset) and d stocks (risky assets) with price processes Xi(t), i = 1, . . . , d. The system (B, X) is assumed to satisfy the stochastic differential equations

dB = r(X, µ)Bds,
d
dXi = Xi bi(X, µ)ds + ij(X, µ)dW j(s) ,
j=1

0  s  T,

(1.1) i = 1, . . . , d, (1.2)

where W = (W 1, . . . , W d) is a d-dimensional standard Wiener process and µ is a Markov chain with finite state space {µ1, . . . , µm}.
Let Xt,x,µk (s), µt,µk (s), 0  t  s  T , be a trajectory of the Markov process (X, µ) (we consider the coefficients of (1.2) to be deterministic), where µt,µk (s) is the Markov chain starting from µk at the moment t and Xt,x,µk (s) is the solution of (1.2) starting from x at the moment t with µ = µt,µk (s). We consider the problem of pricing and hedging a European claim at a maturity time T , specified by a payoff function f which depends on X(T ) and µ(T ) by constructing a generalized self-financing strategy.
The model has a Markovian structure, hence the price of the contingent claim should be associated with a function u(t, x, µk). For evaluating u(t, x, µk), we use the martingale approach. To this end we choose an equivalent probability measure under which the discounted underlying assets are martingales. This martingale measure does not change the probabilistic characteristics of the Markov chain µ which remains a historical one. It turns out that the function u(t, x, µk) (or the collection uk(t, x) := u(t, x, µk), k = 1, . . . , m) satisfies the Cauchy problem for a system of linear parabolic equations. The system can be solved by the Monte Carlo approach.
Analogously to the classical Black-Scholes case, one can expect that the price of the contingent claim f (X(T ), µ(T )) along the trajectory X(s) = Xt,x,µk (s), µ(s) = µt,µk (s) is connected with a wealth process

U (s) = u(s, X(s), µ(s)).

Both X and µ are observable and, consequently, we can construct a trading strategy depending not only on X but also on µ. The system (1.1)­(1.2) has two sources of randomness: the d-dimensional Wiener process W and the Markov chain µ. However only the d-dimensional risky asset X and the saving account B are tradable. Hence the model is incomplete. Besides, in contrast to the classical case, the wealth process U (s) here is discontinuous because of discontinuity of the Markov chain µ (we note that the stock prices Xi(s) remain continuous). The process U (s) is right-continuous with left

2

limits (RCLL or ca`dl`ag process). The discontinuities of U (s) coincide with the jump times of the Markov chain µ.
Let  be a jump time of µ from the state µl to the state µr. Then
U ( -) = u( , X( ), µl) = ul( , X( )), U ( ) = u( , X( ), µr) = ur( , X( )) = U ( +).
Let t <  1 < . . . <   < T ,  = 1, 2, . . ., be all times between t and T where µ(s) has a jump. Between the jumps, i.e. on the intervals [t,  1), ( 1,  2), . . . , ( , T ], the wealth process U (s) is constructed according to a trading strategy ((s), (s)) = ((s), 1(s), . . . , d(s)) depending on (s, X(s), µ(s)) :
(s) = (s, X(s), µ(s)), i(s) = i(s, X(s), µ(s)), i = 1, . . . , d,

and it has the value

d
U (s) = (s)B(s) + i(s)Xi(s).

i=1

If the strategy is self-financing then

(1.3)

d
U (s) = (s)dB(s) + i(s)dXi(s).
i=1

(1.4)

However, the self-financing strategy which is able to replicate the price u(s, X(s), µ(s)), is impossible (see Subsection 4.1). That is why we construct the wealth process in the form of generalized self-financing strategy, i.e. we admit (1.3) with

d
U (s) = (s)dB(s) + i(s)dXi(s) + dDs - dCs
i=1

(1.5)

instead of (1.4), allowing some contributions dDs and consumptions dCs to the wealth process between the jump times.
Starting from the state (x, µk) at the moment t with the initial endowment u(t, x, µk), we construct the process U (s) on the interval [t,  1) according to (1.3) and (1.5). At the moment  1 the Markov chain µ switches from µk to µr and the value of the portfolio changes from u( 1, X( 1), µk) to u( 1, X( 1), µr). Such change in the wealth of the portfolio requires an additional capital (a contribution to the wealth process) if

U ( 1) = u( 1, X( 1), µr) > u( 1, X( 1), µk) = U ( 1-) or withdrawal (for instance, for consumption) in the case

U ( 1) = u( 1, X( 1), µr) < u( 1, X( 1), µk) = U ( 1-).

3

We proceed in the same way on the intervals ( 1,  2), . . . , ( , T ]. Thus, we should take into account the future necessary additional investments (contributions)
Di := max u( i, X( i), µri) - u( i, X( i), µli), 0
and consumptions
Ci := max u( i, X( i), µli) - u( i, X( i), µri), 0 ,
i = 1, . . . , . It is shown that any European contingent claim is attainable due to a generalized
self-financing strategy. This property brings the considered model closer to the classical Black-Scholes model. The generalized replicating strategy on the interval [t, T ] is determined not only by the initial endowment (which is equal to u(t, X(t), µ(t))) and by means of evolution of underlying assets but also due to contributions dDs with consumptions dCs and due to additional funds at the jump moments  1, . . . ,  . So, the proposed strategy requires some additional investments and consumptions. However, and this is very remarkable, they appear in a risk-neutral manner. To be more precise, it is proved that the mean of all the discounted additional funds on any interval [t, t¯ ] is equal to zero. One may say that the constructed here generalized self-financing strategy is self-financing in mean. Let us emphasize that the strategy ((s), (s)), the additional contributions dDs and consumptions dCs, and the additional funds at the jump moments are uniquely defined by the function u(t, x, µ). A payment for the considered option should consist of two parts: the initial endowment (the initial value of the wealth process) and a fair insurance premium in order to compensate for contributions and consumptions arising in future. We see that both financial and insurance aspects appear together in the considered model. However, here we restrict ourselves to constructing the wealth process and the generalized replicating strategy and to determining the necessary additional funds.
In Section 2, we briefly recall the well-known results concerning the classical BlackScholes model (see, e.g. [5], [14]) in the required form. In Section 3, we choose a martingale measure fixing the chain µ as a historical one and construct the price u(t, x, µk). Section 4 is devoted to the generalized self-financing strategy and it contains derivation of formulas for ((s), (s)), dDs, dCs, and U ( i) - U ( i-). In Section 5, it is proved that the mean of all the discounted additional funds on any interval [t, t¯ ] is equal to zero, hence the constructed generalized self-financing strategy is self-financing in mean. Using a Markov chain with single jump on the interval [t, T ], the proposed approach can be exploited for modelling defaults which is illustrated in Section 6.

2 Preliminary

Let us remind the problem of pricing and hedging a European claim at a maturity time T , specified by a payoff function f which depends on X(T ) in the classical Black-Scholes model:

dB = r(X)Bds,
d
dXi = Xi bi(X)ds + ij(X)dW j(s) ,
j=1

0  s  T,

i = 1, . . . , d.

(2.1) (2.2)

In (2.1)­(2.2), W = (W 1, . . . , W d) is a d-dimensional standard Wiener process on a

probability space (, F, P ). As usual, the P -augmentation of the filtration generated by

W is denoted by FtW . We write Ft for the -field FtW . It is assumed that the functions r(x), xibi(x), xiij(x), i, j = 1, . . . , d, k = 1, . . . , m, x  Rd+ := {x : x1 > 0, . . . , xd > 0}, have bounded derivatives with respect to x up to some order. In addition, we assume
that the volatility matrix (x) = {ij(x)} has full rank for any x  R+d . We denote Xt,x(s), 0  t  s  T , the solution of (2.2) starting from x at the

moment t and we denote X(s) := X0,x(s), 0  s  T . The price U (t) of the contingent

claim f (X(T )) is defined as the expectation of the discounted value of claim under the martingale measure P~ :

U (t) = EP~ B(t)B-1(T )f (X(T )) | Ft ,

where r, b, and  are calculated at (s , X(s )). Here it is assumed that Z(s) is a martin-

written in the form

(2.7)

where the sign E(2.6) means that the averaging is carried by virtue of the system (2.6) with W~ being the Brownian motion on the probability space (, F, P~) with filtration Ft.
Due to the Markov property, the price U (t) can be represented in the form

U (t) = u(t, X(t)),

(2.8)

where the function u(t, x) is found according to

u(t, x) = E(2.6)

e-

T t

r(Xt,x(s))dsf (X t,x(T

The price U (t) = u(t, X(t)) coincides with the portfolio value of a trading strategy

((t), (t)) = ((t), 1(t), . . . , d(t)), where  and i denote the portfolio positions in

bond B(t) and stocks Xi(s), respectively. Hence U (t) is given by

3 The pricing function u(t, x, µ)

Let us return to the system (1.1)­(1.2)

dXi = Xi bi(X, µ)ds + ij(X, µ)dW j(s) ,
j=1

0  s  T,

(3.1) i = 1, . . . , d. (3.2)

In (3.1)­(3.2), W = (W 1, . . . , W d) is a d-dimensional standard Wiener process and

µ is a Markov chain with finite state space {µ1, . . . , µm} on a probability space (, F , P ). As usual, the P -augmentation of the filtration generated by W (by µ) is denoted by FtW (by Ftµ). We write Ft for the -field FtW  Ftµ, where FtW and Ftµ are supposed to be
independent.

be the infinitesimal generator matrix of the chain µ with qkl  0, k = l, and

qkl = qk.
l=k

(3.3)

It is assumed that the functions r(x, µk), xibi(x, µk), xiij(x, µk), i, j = 1, . . . , d, k = 1, . . . , m, x  Rd+ := {x : x1 > 0, . . . , xd > 0}, have bounded derivatives with respect
to x up to some order. In addition, we assume that the volatility matrix (x, µk) = {ij(x, µk)} has full rank for any 0  s  T , x  Rd+, and µk, k = 1, . . . , m.
Let Xt,x,µk (s), µt,µk (s), 0  t  s  T , be a trajectory of the Markov process (X, µ),
where µt,µk (s) is the Markov chain starting from µk at the moment t, Xt,x,µk (s) is the solution of (3.2) starting from x at the moment t with µ = µt,µk (s). We denote

7

X(s) := X0,X(0),µ(0)(s), µ(s) := µ0,µ(0)(s), 0  s  T . Consider the problem of pricing and hedging a European claim at a maturity time T , specified by a payoff function f which depends on X(T ) and µ(T ). Applying the martingale approach, we introduce the option's price using a natural analogue of the formula (2.3). So, the price of the option appears here in a postulated way. This price as a function of t, x, µ plays the key role in construction of the replicating self-financing in mean strategy.

3.1 The equivalent martingale measure

Similarly to the classical Black-Scholes case, one can expect that the price of the contingent claim f (X(T ), µ(T )) along the trajectory X(s), µ(s), 0  s  T , is given by

U (t) = EP~ B(t)B-1(T )f (X(T ), µ(T )) | Ft ,

B(s)

,

0  s  T.

(3.4)

In (3.4), Ft = FtW  Ftµ, P~ is an equivalent probability measure under which the discounted stock price processes X~ i(s) := B-1(s)Xi(s) are all martingales.
Define the vector  = (1, . . . , d) by

 = -1(b - r1), 1 = (1, . . . , 1) , b = (b1, . . . , bd) ,  = {ij},

where r, b, and  are evaluated at (X(s ), µ(s )); sometimes we write (s) instead of (X(s), µ(s)). The symbol  is used to distinguish between Black-Scholes case from Section 2 and the considered regime switching situation; cf. (2.4). Below we assume that  satisfies (2.5).
Let us verify that an equivalent martingale measure P~ can be defined by

dP~ := Z(T ),

Z(s) := exp

d
-

dP

i=1

s i(s )dW i(s ) + 1

Indeed, due to the Girsanov theorem the process W~ (s) = (W~ 1(s), . . . , W~ d(s)) with

s
W~ j(s) = W j(s) + j(s )ds ,
0
is a Ft-standard Wiener process. This yields

j = 1, . . . , d,

d dd
dXi = Xi bids + ijdW j(s) = Xi bids - ijj(s)ds + ijdW~ j(s) ,
j=1 j=1 j=1

i.e.,

d

dXi = Xi rds + ijdW~ j(s) , i = 1, . . . , d.

(3.5)

It easily follows from (3.5) that the processes X~ i(s) := B-1(s)Xi(s) are P~-martingales.

where the sign E(3.5) means that the averaging is carried out with respect to µt,µk (s) and Xt,x,µk (s), t  s  T , which is the solution of (3.5). Because the process (X(t), µ(t)) is Markovian, the price U (t) can be represented as a function u of the position (t, x, µ) :

U (t) = u(t, X(t), µ(t)), 0  t  T.

(3.6)

Due to the Markov property,

uk(t, x) := u(t, x, µk) = E(3.5)

It follows from (3.8) that for sufficiently regular functions fk(x) := f (x, µk), k = 1, . . . , m, (for instance, for functions with bounded derivatives up to some order), the functions (3.7) satisfy the following Cauchy problem for the linear system of parabolic partial differential equations:

We derived the system (3.9) by some heuristic arguments. A rigorous proof based on the formula (3.4) is given in the next theorem.

Theorem 3.1. Let the set of functions uk(t, x) = u(t, x, µk), k = 1, ..., m, satisfy (3.9)­ (3.10).Then U (t) defined by (3 .4 ) is equal to

U (t) = u(t, X(t), µ(t)),

where X(t) = X0,X(0),µ(0)(t) is the solution of (3 .2 ) starting from X(0) with µ(t) = µ0,µ(0)(t).

Proof. As Z(s) is a P -martingale, (3.4) and the Bayes formula yield

U (t) = EP~ B(t)B-1(T )f (X(T ), µ(T )) | Ft

This easily implies due to the Feynman-Kac formula that a probabilistic representation for the solution of the problem (3.9)­(3.10) is given by

u(t, x, µk) = EP f (Xt,x,µk (T ), µt,µk (T ))Y t,x,µk,1(T ) ,

(3.16)

where Xt,x,µk (s), Y t,x,µk,1(s) is the solution of (3.12)­(3.13) with µt,µk (s). Comparison of (3.11) and (3.16) completes the proof.

Remark 3.1. It is worth noting that the infinitesimal generator does not depend on the drift b while X and Y do depend on it. The issue here is that a solution of a system of parabolic equations has a lot of different probabilistic representations; see, for instance, [9, 11], where this fact is used for variance reduction when applying the Monte Carlo technique. One possible representation which does not involve the drift b can be given as follows:

uk(t, x) := u(t, x, µk)

=

E (3.18)

j=1

where w is a d-dimensional Wiener process and Ftw and Ftµ are independent. This representation repeats (3.7), (3.5) (however, P~-independence of FtW~ and Ftµ is not proved).

Remark 3.2. Because µ(s) remains constant on any of the intervals [t,  1), [ 1,  2), . . . , [ , T ], it follows from (3.9) that

u 1 (s, x, µ(s)) +

The next section shows that the use of the price function u(s, x, µ) enables us to
construct the replicating wealth process.
Remark 3.3. Suppose that an infinitesimal generator matrix Q(1) is such that qk(1l) > 0 if and only if qkl > 0. It is known ([13], P. 39) that the new law of the Markov chain is equivalent to the old one. Basing on the new law we can introduce the equivalent martingale measure P~(1) instead of the measure P~ and repeat the previous construction. Clearly, we obtain the new pricing function u(1)(t, x, µk) which satisfies the system (3.9)­ (3.10) with qk(1l) instead of qkl. The questions concerning the choice of an equivalent martingale measure are not considered here. However, bearing in mind the problem of
evaluating a fair insurance premium, the real world probability measure for µ given by
Q seems to be suitable.

4 The wealth process, the generalized self-financing strategy, attainability

Let t <  1 < . . . <   < t¯, 0  t < t¯  T , be all the times between t and t¯ where µ(s) has a jump. Using the Ito formula for u(s, X(s), µ(s)) on the intervals [ 0,  1), ( 1,  2), . . . , ( ,  +1],  0 := t,  +1 := t¯, we obtain

On an interval [t, t¯ ], 0  t  t¯  T , we get (see [15])

with the preceding notation the sum

In contrast to the classical case, the process

U (s) = u(s, X(s), µ(s))

(4.3)

here is discontinuous on [t, T ] because of discontinuity of the Markov chain µ (we note that the asset prices Xi(s) remain continuous). The process U (s) is right-continuous

12

with left limits (RCLL process), i.e. it is ca`dl`ag. The discontinuity moments of U (s) coincide with the jump times  i of the Markov chain µ which are observable.

4.1 Impossibility of a replicating self-financing strategy

Let us suppose for a moment that U (s) is the value of a self-financing portfolio defined
by (s, s) = (s, 1s, . . . , sd) on the interval ( i,  i+1), where s and is denote the portfolio positions in the bond B(s) and stocks Xi(s), respectively:

d
U (s) = sB(s) + si Xi(s),  i < s <  i+1.
i=1
The trading strategy (s, s) is self-financing on ( i,  i+1) if
d
dU = sdB + isdXi
i=1 dd
= srBds + si Xi rds + ijdW~ j(s) ,  i < s <  i+1.
i=1 j=1
Suppose that U (s) of the form (4.4) replicates the price u. It follows from (4.3)

(4.4) (4.5)

du = dU,  i < s <  i+1.

(4.6)

Let µ(s) = µk under  i < s <  i+1. By comparing (4.1) and (4.5), we conclude

si

=

i(s, X(s), µ(s))

=

u xi (s, X(s), µ(s))

(s,

and

Now (4.6), (4.4), and (4.7) imply

 i < s <  i+1.

(4.7) (4.8)

sB(s) = uk -

si Xi(s) = uk -

Substituting this in (4.8) yields

(4.10)

However, (4.10) contradicts to (3.9). Hence the trading strategy of the form (4.4)­(4.5) is impossible and we should allow some contributions dDs and consumption dCs to the wealth process.

13

4.2 The generalized self-financing strategy

We propose to construct the wealth process in the form (4.4) but with the generalized self-financing strategy (see, e.g. [2]):

dd
dU = srBds + isXi rds + ijdW~ j(s) + dDs - dCs,
i=1 j=1
µ(s) = µk,  i < s <  i+1,

(4.11)

with contributions dDs and consumptions dCs. A particular choice is given by

dDs = qkuk(s, X(s))ds, dCs = qklul(s, X(s))ds.
l=k

(4.12)

The equality (4.11) is equivalent to

dd

Bds + Xidsi + dXidsi = qkukds - qklulds,

i=1 i=1

l=k

 i < s <  i+1.

(4.13)

Comparing (4.1) and (4.11) yields

si

=

uk xi

(s,

X

(s)),

 i < s <  i+1,

(4.14)

and it follows from (4.3) and (4.14) that

1 s = B(s)

uk(s, X(s)) -

d

X

i(s)

uk xi

(s,

X

(s))

,

 i < s <  i+1.

i=1

(4.15)

It is worth noting that the formulas (4.14)­(4.15) coincide with (2.14). However, the strategy (4.14)­(4.15) is not self-financing in contrast to the classical case.
The equations (4.1) and (4.11) replace (4.8) by the formula

uk + 1 s 2

d

aij

2uk xixj

= srB + qkukds -

qklulds

i,j=1

l=k

which is consistent with (3.9) if we take into account (4.4). The equality (4.13) for the strategy (4.14)­(4.15) can be checked by direct calculus.

4.3 Dynamics of the wealth replicating process
This section briefly describes the evolution of the wealth process and of the additional funds on the interval [t, T ]. The initial value U (t) of the wealth process is equal to the initial endowment u(t, x, µ(t)). Due to (4.3), we have
U (s) = u(s, X(s), µ(s)), µ(s) = µ(t), t  s <  1.
14

Besides, U (s) satisfies (4.3), (4.11) and the funds Ds, Cs are found as (see (4.12)):

Ds = Cs =

s
qµ(t)u(s , X(s ), µ(t))ds ,
t s
qµ(t)lu(s , X(s ), l)ds ,
t l=µ(t)

t  s < 1.

(4.16)

So, starting from the initial endowment, the portfolio value U (s) changes on [t,  1) through trading in the saving account B and in the underlying assets X1, . . . , Xd ac-
cording to (4.14)­(4.15) and due to the contributions dDs and consumptions dCs according to (4.16). Clearly, U ( 1-) = u( 1-, X( 1), µ(t)). Let the chain µ jump at the moment  1 from the state µ( 1-) = µ(t) to the state µ( 1). Then we set U ( 1) = u( 1, X( 1), µ( 1)). If the difference

U ( 1) - U ( 1-) = u( 1, X( 1), µ( 1)) - u( 1-, X( 1), µ(t))

is positive, we need the additional contribution at the moment  1 in order to have U ( 1) for the wealth process U . And it requires the consumption U ( 1-)-U ( 1) if the difference U ( 1)-U ( 1-) is negative. On the intervals [ 1,  2), . . . , [ , T ] and at the jump moments  2, . . . ,   the behavior of the wealth process is similar. In particular, we obtain
U (T ) = u(T, Xt,x,µ(t)(T ), µt,µ(t)(T )) = f (Xt,x,µ(t)(T ), µt,µ(t)(T )).

This equality shows that any European contingent claim is attainable in the considered model. Such a property is usual for complete markets. However, it is not fulfilled for incomplete markets in the class of self-financing strategies. In our case the considered market is incomplete and the attainability is achieved by using a generalized self-financing strategy.
Remark 4.1. Computational aspects of the considered model can be developed on the base of numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (see [6, 9, 11]) using special methods from computational finance, in particular, Monte Carlo methods [4]. A lot of works are devoted to numerics in finance; see e.g. [10] and [12] among many others.

5 The generalized self-financing strategy is self-financing in mean

Introduce the value at time t of the s-price u :

v(s, Xt,x,µ(t)(s), µt,µ(t)(s))

:= e-

s t

r(X t,x,µ(t) (s

),µt,µ(t) (s

µt,µ(t)(s)).

(5.1)

15

The discounted additional funds F1 during the time from t to T inside the intervals ( i,  i+1), i = 0, . . . ,  with  0 := t and   + 1 := T , are equal to

Theorem 5.1. The P~-mean of all the discounted additional funds on the interval [t, T ] is equal to zero.

Proof. Applying the Ito formula to the function v on the interval [t, T ] (see [3], [15]), we obtain

v(T, X(T ), µ(T )) - v(t, X(t), µ(t)) =

(5.5)

According to the definition of price u (see (3.7) the mean of the left-hand side of (5.5) is equal to zero, hence the P~-mean of the right-hand side is equal to EP~(F1 + F2) = 0. Theorem 5.1 is proved.
Corollary 5.1.By the same way it can be proved that the P~-mean of all the discounted additional funds on the any interval [t, t¯ ], t < t¯  T , is equal to zero.

6 A single jump case
As an example, let us consider the situation when there is only a single jump of the Markov chain on the interval [t, T ]. Such a situation can be modelled by the system (3.1)­(3.2) where the chain µ has absorbing states. For definiteness, consider the chain

16

with two states µ1 and µ2 where µ2 is the absorbing state. The infinitesimal generator matrix of such chain is equal to

-q q Q = , q > 0.
00

Let  > t be a (single) jump time of the chain µt,µ1(s). If  > T then during the time t  s  T the chain has no jumps, i.e., µt,µ1(s)  µ1, t  s  T . The price u(t, x, µk), k = 1, 2, is given by (3.7) where the functions u1(t, x), u2(t, x) satisfy the system (see (3.9)­(3.10)):

(6.1) (6.2)

This system can be solved sequentially starting from the second equation. We also note that in this case, the generalized self-financing strategy on the interval [ , T ] reduces to self-financing one.
If u2( , x) u1( , x) then there is a possibility of default. Consider the particular case when r1 = r2 := r, ai1j = a2ij := aij, but

f2(x)  f1(x).

(6.3)

Subtracting (6.1) from (6.2), we obtain

-r(u2 - u1) - q(u2 - u1) = 0, u2 - u1 = f2 - f1  0.

(6.4)

It follows from (6.3) and (6.4) that

u2(s, x) - u1(s, x)  0, t  s  T.

(6.5)

Therefore

F1 =

e-

s t

Because the integrand here is negative, the value -e-

s t

rds

q[u1(s,

u2(s,

X (s))]ds

is positive. This value is the discounted consumption on [s, s + ds] and therefore -F1 is

17

the summarized discounted consumption of the wealth process on the interval [t,   T ].

Further,

F2 =

e-

 t

rds

[u2(

-

u1(

X (

t <   T,

0,  > T,

is positive, hence F2 is the necessary additional contribution to the wealth process. According to Theorem 5.1 EP~F2 = -EP~F1. In the case of default, EP~F2 0 and therefore the P~-mean of the discounted consumption is large as well. This can be done only at
cost of the sufficiently large endowment. This fact corresponds with our intuition: in the
prevision of a serious default the price of the option should be large.

7 Summary and outlook
The paper considers the problem of pricing and hedging a European-type contingent claim in an incomplete market with regime switching. First we show that a replicating self-financing strategies in this situation does not exist. Instead, for any contingent claim, we construct a generalized self-financing strategy. Such a strategy requires not only an initial endowment but also some additional funds (additional investments and consumptions) which have to be involved both at the jump moments of the Markov chain and continuously between the jump moments. However, these additional funds are risk-neutral, so that the generalized self-financing strategy is self-financing in mean.
The construction is based on the general martingale approach and it is reduced to a system of linear parabolic differential equations which can be solved numerically by a Monte Carlo method.
A payment for the considered option should consist of two parts: the initial endowment and a fair insurance premium in order to compensate for contributions and consumptions arising in future. So, both financial and insurance aspects appear together in the considered model. This paper restricts itself to constructing the generalized replicating strategy and to determining the necessary additional funds. The insurance premium aspect will be studied elsewhere.
