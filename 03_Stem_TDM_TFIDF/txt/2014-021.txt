Abstract The influence of maternal health problems on child's worrying status is important in practice in terms of the intervention of maternal health problems early for the influence on child's worrying status. Conventional methods apply symmetric prior distributions such as a normal distribution or a Laplace distribution for regression coefficients, which may be suitable for median regression and exhibit no robustness to outliers. This work develops a quantile regression on linear panel data model without heterogeneity from a Bayesian point of view, i.e., upon a location-scale mixture representation of the asymmetric Laplace error distribution, this work provides how the posterior distribution can be sampled and summarized by Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Applying this approach to the 1970 British Cohort Study data, it finds that a different maternal health problem has different influence on child's worrying status at different quantiles. In addition, applying stochastic search variable selection for maternal health problems to the 1970 British Cohort Study data, it finds that maternal nervous breakdown, in

1 Introduction
In many applications, conventional regression analysis addressed much attention and focuses on the mean effect or optimal forecasting in a mean squared error sense. Since a set of quantles often provides more complete description of the response distribution than the mean, over classical mean regression, quantile regression not only quantifies the relationship between quantiles of the response distribution and covariates, but also exhibits robustness to outliers and has a wide applicability (Buchinsky, 1998; Yu et al., 2003; and Koenker, 2005). Quantile regression has been applied in many areas, for example, to calculate Value at Risk and expected shortfall for financial risk management (Taylor, 2008), to study the relationship between GDP and population (Schnabel and Eilers, 2009) , to study the correlation of the wage and the level of education (H¨ardle and Song, 2010), and to estimate the volatility of temperatures (Guo and Ha¨rdle (2012).
For classical quantile regression, the error distribution is often assumed to have the p-th quantile equal to zero, see, for example, Yu and Stander (2007), and classical qantile regression parameters depend on asymptotic normality which is assumed unbiased and normal. Inaddition, confidence intervals depends on the density function of model error which is difficult to estimate reliability. On the contrary, credible intervals from Bayesian inference can avoid these problems, whatever sample sizes. Aside from these, Bayesian inference can take historical information or expert opinion easily via prior information. Therefore Bayesian quantile regression is naturally motivated.
2

Quantile regression is attempted in Bayesian framework in both theoretical and applied econometric analysis, for example, Walker and Mallick (1999), Kottas and Gelfand (2001), and Hanson and Johnson (2002) on median regression (one special quantile regression), and Yu and Moyeed (2001), Tsionas (2003) and Kozumi and Kobayashi (2010) on general quantile regression with the asymmetric Laplace density for the errors. In addition, on infinite mixture model, Kottas and Krnjajic (2009) on Bayesian semi-parametric approach, Yu (2002), Taddy and Kottas (2010) and Yue and Rue (2011) on Bayesian nonparametric approach. However, few studies have been on Bayesian quantile regression for panel data (Yuan and Yin, 2010; Reich et al., 2010).
This paper develops a Bayesian quantile regression for linear panel data without heterogeneity. For posterior inference, upon a location-scale mixture representation of the asymmetric Laplace error distribution, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm and develop Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (see, e.g., Chib 2001; Liu 2001; Gamerman and Lopes 2006). All posterior densities are fully tractable and easy to sample, making the Gibbs sampler appealing when several quantile regressions are required at one time. In addition, the proposed Gibbs sampler can be applied for the calculation of the marginal likelihood and the variable selection.
For variable selection, several criteria have been proposed (see, for example, Zwick and Velicer, 1986), though no agreement has emerged in the literature on optimal criterion. Aside from the classical literature, Bayesian approach focus on an unknown number of variables (Fru¨hwirth-Schnatter and Lopes, 2009).Variable selection in modeling with Bayesian quantile regression is difficult due to the computational efficiency. This work applies stochastic search variable selection based on Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
We apply Bayesian approach to the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS) to analyze the influence of maternal health problems on child's worrying status. This is the first instance, as we know, in which the influences of maternal health problems are estimated to account for child's worrying status. We find that different maternal health problems have different influence on child's worrying status at different quantiles, and find that maternal nervous breakdown, in our method, among the 25 maternal health problems, contributes most to influence the child's worrying status.
This paper joins the literature in health economics and personality psychology. While
3

it is established in psychology on their importance (see, for example, Roberts et al., 2006, 2007; Hampson and Friedman, 2008), and in economics for the influence of personality traits on health (Kaestner and Callison, 2011; Conti et al., 2010) and health-related behaviors (Heckman et al., 2006; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010; Conti et al., 2010), it is less recognized in economics on the influence of maternal health problems on child's worrying status.
Using principal component analysis, a few studies using the BCS data can be found in the economic literature. Blanden et al. (2007) constructs several non-cognitive measures to analyze their role in explaining the rise in intergenerational income persistence across the 1958 and the 1970 cohorts. Feinstein (2000) constructs several indicators of psychological and behavioral development to analyze their effects on education and labor market outcomes. Murasko (2007) computes the standardized raw scores from the locus of control and selfesteem scales and finds that both are significant predictors of self-reported poor health at age 30. This analysis goes beyond those studies, as we apply Bayesian inference and variable selection to examine the influence of maternal health problems on child's worrying status.
Our work contributes an important methodological advancement to these literatures. When in a data-rich environment, researchers used traditional methods to estimate and select variables, and in many cases they have been limited by the computing challenging. Using the BCS data, we propose Bayesian inference and apply variable selection in this paper, and find that maternal's different health problems have different influence on child's worrying status at different quantiles, and that maternal nervous breakdown, in our method, among the 25 maternal health problems, contributes most to influence the child's worrying status.
The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we describe the BCS data. Section 3 outlines the basic model, while Section 4 develops MCMC method for quantile regression model and explain how the MCMC output may be used to compute the marginal likelihoods and for variable selection. Empirical implementation and results for our Bayesian approach are shown in Section 5. Section 6 concludes our findings.

2 Data: The British Cohort Study
The data, we use in this paper, are from the BCS, a survey of all babies born (alive or dead) after the 24-th week of gestation from 00.01 hours on Sunday, 5th April to 24.00 hours on Saturday, 11 April, 1970 in places including England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Seven surveys, in detail, respectively in 1975, 1980, 1986, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008, are followed up so far to trace all members of the birth cohort. Information on background characteristics is drawn from the survey in 1975 and 1980 on maternal health problems, and on child's worrying status from the survey in 1980 and 1986. Samples from the family of multiple children are excluded for the reason of peer effect, and samples for the respondents with any missing information on those background characteristics are also excluded. A sample of size 3,426 is left for our analysis in this paper.
2.1 Rutter Score Derived Variable for Child
Applying the Rutter Behaviour Scale question "Often worried?" for child, the Rutter score derived variable, Y , was derived, where the question was completed by the cohort member's parent (usually the mother) in the BCS 1980 and 1986 follow-up data sets. For our case, the discrete choice results from 1 (Does not worried), 2 (Somewhat worried), 3 (Certainly worried).
2.2 Mother Malaise Score Derived Variables
Applying the Malaise Inventory ("How you feel") completed by the cohort member's parent (usually the mother), the mother malaise score derived variables were derived on behalf of the cohort member and included in the BCS 1975 and 1980 follow-up data sets. These 25 variables were named in the Mother Malaise data sets as follows:
(1) Do you often have backache? (X1) (2) Do you feel tired most of the time? (X2) (3) Do you often feel depressed? (X3) (4) Do you often have bad headaches? (X4) (5) Do you often get worried about things? (X5) (6) Do you usually have great difficulty in falling or staying asleep? (X6)
5

(7) Do you usually wake unnecessarily early in the morning? (X7) (8) Do you wear yourself out worrying about your health? (X8) (9) Do you often get into a violent rage? (X9) (10) Do people annoy and irritate you? (X10) (11) Have you at times had a twitching of the face, head or shoulders? (X11) (12) Do you suddenly become scared for no good reason? (X12) (13) Are you scared to be alone when there are not friends near you? (X13) (14) Are you easily upset or irritated? (X14) (15) Are you frightened of going out alone or of meeting people? (X15) (16) Are you constantly keyed up and jittery? (X16) (17) Do you suffer from indigestion? (X17) (18) Do you suffer from an upset stomach? (X18) (19) Is your appetite poor? (X19) (20) Does every little thing get on your nerves and wear you out? (X20) (21) Does your heart often race like mad? (X21) (22) Do you often have bad pain in eyes? (X22) (23) Are you troubled with rheumatism or fibrosis? (X23) (24) Have you ever had a nervous breakdown? (X24) (25) Do you have other health problems? (X25)
3 Potential Outcome Model
Let Yit be the Rutter score derived variable for the i-th cohort member surveyed at the t-th sweep, and X1,it, X2,it,..., X25,it the mother malaise score derived variables for the i-th cohort member's parent (usually the mother) surveyed at the t-th sweep. Our linear panel data model without heterogeneity is introduced as follows.
6

Yit = 0 + 1X1,it + 2X2,it + 3X3,it + 4X4,it + 5X5,it + 6X6,it + 7X7,it + 8X8,it + 9X9,it + 10X10,it + 11X11,it + 12X12,it + 13X13,it + 14X14,it + 15X15,it + 16X16,it + 17X17,it + 18X18,it + 19X19,it + 20X20,it + 21X21,it + 22X22,it + 23X23,it + 24X24,it + 25X25,it + it.

(1)

for i = 1, 2, ..., 3426, t = 1, 2, where . is unknown parameter, and it is is an idiosyncratic error term assumed to be independent of the Rutter score derived variable and mother malaise score derived variables.

4 Bayesian Inference and Variable Selection

In the study, we consider quantile regression to estimate  from:

3426 2

25

min p(Yit - jXj;it - 0),

i=1 t=1

j=1

where p(.) is the check function with

(2)

p(u)  {p - I(u < 0)} · u,

(3)

for 0 < p < 1, where I(.) is the indicator function. Instead of classical approach, a Bayesian approach and MCMC algorithm will be developed for posterior inference.

4.1 Asymmetric Laplace Distribution

For a Bayesian analysis, the error term it is assumed to follow the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) with density

fAL(it)

=

p(1 - 

p)

exp{-p(

it 

)},

(4)

7

where  is the scale parameter. For the properties of this distribution, see, for example,

Yu and Moyeed (2001), Yu and Zhang (2005). Note that the p-th quantile of it is zero,

E(it)

=

1-2p p(1-p)

,

and

Var(it)

=

.1-2p+2p2
p2(1-p)2

To develop MCMC algorithm for the quantile regression, a location scale mixture repre-

sentation is applied:

 it = vit +  vituit,

(5)

where



=

1-2p p(1-p)

,



=

2 p(1-p)

,

vit



()

and

uit



N(0, 1)

are

mutually

independent

random

variables, () is the exponential distribution with mean  (Kozumi and Kobayashi, 2010).

Thus the panel data model without heterogeneity is represented as follows.

Yit = 0 + 1X1,it + 2X2,it + 3X3,it + 4X4,it + 5X5,it + 6X6,it
+ 7X7,it + 8X8,it + 9X9,it + 10X10,it + 11X11,it + 12X12,it
+ 13X13,it + 14X14,it + 15X15,it + 16X16,it + 17X17,it + 18X18,it
+ 19X19,it + 20X20,it + 21X21,it + 22X22,it + 23X23,it + 24X24,it 
+ 25X25,it + vit +  vituit,

(6)

where vit  () and uit  N(0, 1) are mutually independent random variables.

To begin posterior inference, some prior distributions are supposed as follows: (1)  

N(0,

B0),

where





(0,

1,

...,

25),

and

0,

B0

are

specified

parameters;

(2)





IG(

n0 2

,

s0 2

),

where IG(a, b) is the inverse Gamma distribution with the parameters a and b, and n0, s0

are specified parameters; (3)   N(0, D0), where 0, D0 are specified parameters; (4) 2 

IG(

m0 2

,

r0 2

),

where

m0, r0

are

specified

parameters.

It is convenient to construct a MCMC

algorithm.

4.2 Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm
A MCMC algorithm for the quantile regression is constructed by sampling {vit}, , , and 2 from their full conditional distributions (Chib, 1992). A tractable and efficient Gibbs sampler is proposed as follows.

4.3 Marginal Likelihood
The marginal likelihood of the panel data model is defined as

(14) (15)

m(Y ) = f (Y |)()d,

(16)

9

where f (Y |) is the sampling density of the data {Y } and () is the prior of the model specific parameter .
The marginal likelihood can be reformulated as

f (Y |)() m(Y ) = (|Y ) ,

(17)

from which it is suggested (Chib 1995) to estimate the marginal likelihood as follows.

log m(Y ) = log f (Y |) + log () - log (|Y ),

(18)

where  is a particular high density point, typically the posterior mean or mode. For   {, , 2} and Y  {Yit} in the panel data model, the posterior ordinate (|Y )
is estimated by the following decomposition.

(|Y ) = (|Y )(|, Y )(2|Y ),

(19)

marginalized over the latent variables  {i} and v  {vit}, since the ordinates (|Y ), (|, Y ), and (2|Y ) can be estimated according to Chib (1995).
The likelihood ordinate f (Y |) can be estimated by Chib method from

f (Y

|)

=

f (Y |, )(|) (|Y, ) ,

(20)

where  is the posterior mean of , and

3426 2

f (Y |, ) =

fAL(Yit -  Xit - 0 - i),

i=1 t=1

(21)

and

(|)

=

1 22

exp{-

3426 i=1

i2

22

}.

(22)

And (|Y, ) can be estimated from the output of a reduced Gibbs run with  fixed at 

and sampling over {, v}.

10

4.4 Variable Selection

To perform the variable selection for the quantile regression, an indicator vector is defined

as follows.   (0, 1, ..., 25), where 0 = 1, and i = 1 for i  2 if i is included in the

model (i = 0), and i = 0 for i  2 if i is excluded in the model (i = 0).

Given , k denote the size of the -th subset model, k =  1, and k and Xk,it are

k × 1 vectors corresponding to all the components of  and Xit such that the corresponding

i's are equal to 1. Given , the following prior assumptions are supposed.

1.

k |, 



N(0, 2(Xk V Xk )-1),

where

p()

and

each

i



Exp{

 p(1-p)

}.

2. A prior distribution over model space  is given by p(|)  k (1 - )k-k .

3.   beta(a0, b0). Under the prior assumptions, a MCMC algorithm can be developed to compute posterior

model probabilities in quantile regression by running the Gibbs sampler, and the marginal

likelihood of Y under model  can be obtained by integrating out k and ,

p(Y |, , X)  p()d p(Y |k , , , , X)p(k |, , )p(|)dk .

(23)

Integrating out k and  as a normal integral and an inverse gamma integral,

Y |, , X

Then, the Gibbs sampler can be implemented to generate samples of

5 Real Data Application
In this section, the Bayesian quantile regression is applied to analysis the British Cohort study data. This data set was extensively investigated for many sorts of topics, but this paper examines the influence of maternal health problems on child's worrying status. There are 3426 observations, 25 predictor variables, and one response variable. We assume a quantile regression model between the response variable and the 25 covariates, plus an intercept.
In Table 1, upon Bayesian quantile regression applying the MCMC package in R, the
11

model is evaluated at three different quantiles 0.05, 0.5 and 0.95. The maternal health problems have different influence on child's worrying status at different quantiles, through MCMC quantile regression iteration 50001 of 51000, in detail, i have different estmates at different quantiles for each i = 0, ..., 25 . 24 and 25 have the biggest absolute value for the three quantiles, except for 0.
Table 2 describes the summary at the quantile 0.05 aplying Bayesian quantile regression through the MCMC package in R. Upon Bayesian quantile regression applying the MCMC package in R, Table 3 sumarizes the empirical mean and standard deviation for each variable Xi ( i = 1, ..., 25), and standard error of the mean for the model at the quantile 0.05. In this case, X24 has the biggest standard deviation, and X25 has the next biggest standard deviation. Upon Bayesian quantile regression at the quantile 0.05 applying the MCMC package in R, Table 4 sumarrizes the quantiles for each variable Xi ( i = 1, ..., 25) .
Tables 5-7 sumarrizes the same contents for the quantile 0.50, and Tables 8-10 for the quantile 0.95.
Applying the stochastic search variable selection, the top models and the posterior model probabilities are summerized in Table 11-13 for the different quantiles 0.05, 0.5 and 0.95. The maternal nervous breakdown, X24, among the 25 maternal health problems, contributed most to child's worrying status for the three different quantiles, and the maternal other health problems, X25, contributed the next most. At the quantile 0.05, maternal often feel depressed, X3, contributed the third most, while maternal feel tired most of the time, X2, contributed respectively the third and fourth most at the quantile 0.50 and 0.95.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we developed a Bayesian quantile regression on linear panel data model without heterogeneity, in particular, upon a location-scale mixture representation of the asymmetric Laplace error distribution, this paper provides how the posterior distribution can be sampled and summarized by MCMC method.
In addition, the influence of maternal health problems on child's worrying status was estimated applying the 1970 BCS data, and we find that maternal's different health problem has different influence on child's worrying status at different quantiles, also that maternal
12

nervous breakdown, in our method, among the 25 maternal health problems, contributes most to influence the child's worrying status.
Our findings have high policy relevance in terms of the importance of the intervention of maternal nervous breakdown early for the influence on child's worrying statuts.
