Abstract
This paper aims at explanation of the R-package HAC, which provides user friendly methods for dealing with high-dimensional hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC). A computationally efficient estimation procedure allows to recover the structure and the parameters of HACs from data. In addition, arbitrary HACs can be constructed to sample random vectors and to compute the values of the corresponding cumulative distribution as well as density functions. Accurate graphics of the important characteristics of the package's object hac can be produced by the generic plot function.

1. Introduction
The success of copulae in applied statistics started at the end of the 90th, when Embrechts, McNeil, and Straumann (1999) introduced copula to empirical finance in the context of risk management. Nowadays, quantitative orientated sciences like biostatistics and hydrology were doing attempts of measuring the dependence of random variables with copulae, e.g., Lakhal-Chaieb (2010); Acar, Craiu, and Yao (2011); Ba´rdossy (2006); Genest and Favre (2007); B´ardossy and Li (2008). In finance, copulae became a standard tool, explicitly on VaR measurement and in valuation of structured credit portfolios, see Mendes and Souza (2004); Junker and May (2005) and Li (2000) respectively. This paper targets to provide the necessary tools for academics and practitioners for simple and effective use of HAC in their analysis.
Copula is the function splitting the multivariate distribution into the margins and a pure dependency component. Formally copulae were introduced in Sklar (1959) stating that if F is an arbitrary d-dimensional continuous distribution function of the random variables X1, . . . , Xd, then the associated copula is unique and defined as a continuous function C : [0, 1]d  [0, 1] which satisfies the equality
C(u1, . . . , ud) = F {F1-1(u1), . . . , Fd-1(ud)}, u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1],
where F1-1(·), . . . , Fd-1(·) are the quantile functions of the corresponding marginal distributions F1(x1), . . . , Fd(xd). For an overview and recent developments of copulae we refer to

Nelsen (2006), Cherubini, Luciano, and Vecchiato (2004), Joe (1997) and Jaworski, Durante, Ha¨rdle, and Rychlik (2010). If F belongs to the class of elliptical distributions, then C is an elliptical copula, which in most cases cannot be given explicitly, because the distribution function F and the inverse marginal distributions Fi usually have integral representations. One of the classes that overcomes this drawback of elliptical copulae is the class of Archimedean copulae, which however is very restrictive even for moderate dimensions. Among other packages dealing with Archimedean copula, we would like to mention the copula and the fCopulae package, c.f. Yan (2007), Kojadinovic and Yan (2010) and Wuertz et al. (2009). HAC generalizes the concept of simple Archimedean copulae by substituting (a) marginal distribution(s) by a further HAC. This class is thoroughly analyzed in Whelan (2004); Savu and Trede (2010); Embrechts, Lindskog, and McNeil (2003); Hofert (2011). The first sampling algorithms for special HAC structures were provided by the QRMlib package of McNeil and Ulman (2011), which last available version on CRAN is 1.4.5.1, which is not updated anymore. Hofert and Ma¨chler (2011) presented the comprehensive nacopula package which among other features allows to sample from arbitrary HAC and was integrated into the package copula from version 0.8-1. The central contribution of the HAC package is the estimation of the parameter and the structure for this class of copulae, as discussed in Okhrin, Okhrin, and Schmid (2011a), including a simple and intuitive representation of HACs as R-objects of the class hac. The main estimation procedure relies on a multi-stage Maximum Likelihood (ML) procedure, which determines the parameter and the structure simultaneously. This elegant procedure endows the estimator with the usual asymptotic properties but avoids the computationally intensive one-step ML estimation, which is also implemented for a predetermined structure. Besides, the package offers functions to produce graphics of the copula's structure, to sample random vectors from a given copula and to compute values of the corresponding distribution and density.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes shortly the theoretical aspects of HAC and its estimation. Section 3 describes the functions of the HAC package and section 4 presents a simulation study. Section 5 concludes.

2. Hierarchical Archimedean copulae

As mentioned above, the large class of copulae, which can describe tail dependency, nonellipticity, and what is most important, has close form representation

C(u1, . . . , ud; ) = {-1(u1) + · · · + -1(ud)}, u1, . . . , ud  [0, 1],

(1)

where   L = { : [0; )  [0, 1] | (0) = 1, () = 0; (-1)j(j)  0; j = 1, . . . , d - 2} and (-1)d-2(d-2)(x) being non-decreasing and convex on [0, ), is the class of Archimedean copulae. The function  is called the generator of the copula and commonly depends on a single parameter . For example, the Gumbel generator is given by  = exp(-x1/) for 0  x < , 1   < . Detailed reviews of the properties of Archimedean copulae can be found in McNeil and Neslehova´ (2009) as well as in Joe (1996).
A disadvantage of Archimedean copulae is the fact that the multivariate dependency structure is very restricted, since it typically depends on a single parameter of the generator function . Moreover, the rendered dependency is symmetric with respect to the permutation of variables, i.e., the distribution is exchangeable. HACs (also called nested Archimedean copulae)

Ostap Okhrin, Alexander Ristig

overcome this problem by considering the compositions of simple Archimedean copulae. For example, the special case of a four-dimensional HAC can be given by

C(u1, . . . , u4) = C1{C2(u1, . . . , u3), u4} = 3{3-1  C2(u1, . . . , u3) + 3-1(u4)} = 3{3-1  2[2-1{C3(u1, u2)} + -2 1(u3)] + 3-1(u4)}.

(2)

The form (2) is called fully nested HAC. The composition can be applied recursively using dif-
ferent segmentations of variables leading to more complex HACs. For notational convenience we denote the structure of a HAC by s = {(. . . (i1 . . . ij1) . . . (. . . ) . . . )}, where i  {1, . . . , d} is a reordering of the indices of the variables and sj denotes the structure of subcopulae with sd = s. Further, let the d-dimensional HAC be denoted by C(u1, . . . , ud; s, ), where  denotes the vector of feasible dependency parameters. Thus, the fully nested HAC, given in (2), can
be expressed as

C(u1, . . . , u4; s = (((12)3)4), ) = C{u1, . . . , u4; ((s3)4), (1, . . . , 3) } = 3 (-31  C{u1, . . . , u3; ((s2)(3)), (1, 2) } + -31(u4)).
Figure 1 presents the four-dimensional fully and partially nested Archimedean copula.

q (((u1.u2).u3).u4) = 2

q ((u4.u3).(u1.u2)) = 2

u4 ((u1.u2).u3) = 3 u3 (u1.u2) = 4 u1 u2

(u4.u3) = 3

(u1.u2) = 4

HACs can adopt arbitrary elaborate structures s. This makes it a very flexible and simultaneously parsimonious distribution model. The generators i within a HAC can come either from a single generator family or from different generator families. If the i's belong to the same family, then the required complete monotonicity of -i1+1  i usually imposes some constraints on the parameters 1, . . . , d-1. Theorem 4.4 of McNeil (2008) provides sufficient conditions on the generator functions to guarantee that C is a copula. It holds that if i  L, for i = 1, . . . , d - 1, and -i1+1  i have completely monotone derivatives, then C is a copula for d  2. For the majority of generators a feasible HAC requires decreasing parameters from the highest to the lowest hierarchical level. However, in the case of different families within a single HAC, the condition of complete monotonicity is not always fulfilled, see Hofert (2011). In our study, we consider HAC only with generators from the same family. If we use the same single-parameter generator function on each level, but with a different value of , we may specify the whole distribution with at most d - 1 parameters. From this point of view, the HAC approach can be seen as an alternative to covariance driven models. But for each HAC not only the parameters are unknown, but also the structure has to be determined. One possible

4 Hierarchical Archimedean Copulae: The HAC Package
procedure is to enumerate and to estimate all possible HACs. Using a suitable goodness-of-fit test, the optimal structure then can be determined. This approach is however unrealistic in practice, because the variety of different structures is enormously large even in moderate dimensions. Okhrin et al. (2011a) suggest a computationally efficient procedure, which allows to estimate HACs recursively. The HAC package provides this method for estimating the HAC parameters and structure in a user-friendly way.
2.1. Estimation of HAC
In the most cases the discussion is constrained to binary copulae, i.e., at each level of the hierarchy only two variables are joined together. The whole procedure can be written in the recursive way, where at the first iteration step we fit a bivariate copula to every couple of the variables. The couple of variables with strongest dependency is selected. We denote the respective estimator of the parameter at the first level by ^1 and the set of indices of the variables by I1. The selected couple is joined together to define the pseudo-variable ZI1 d=ef C{(I1); ^1, 1}. At the next step, we proceed in the same way by considering the remaining variables and the new pseudo-variable as the new set of variables. This procedure allows us to determine the estimated structure of the copula and if the restrictions on the parameters are fulfilled always leads to a feasible copula function with d - 1 parameters. Nevertheless, if the true copula is not binary, the procedure might return a slightly misspecified structure. Despite of a difference in the structures, the difference in the distribution functions is in general minor. To allow more sophisticated structures, we aggregate the variables of the estimated copula afterwards, if the absolute value of the difference of two successive nodes is smaller than a fixed small threshold, i.e., 1 - 2 < , with 1 > 2, as suggested by Okhrin et al. (2011a).
For better understanding, let us consider a three-dimensional example with uj, j = 1 . . . , 3, being uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. All possible pairs C(12)(u1, u2, ^(12)), C(13)(u1, u3, ^(13)) and C(23)(u2, u3, ^(23)) are estimated by regular ML, see Franke, Ha¨rdle, and Hafner (2011). To compare the strengths of the fit one can use goodness-of-fit tests, which are however computationally complicated and do not necessarily lead to a function which will be a copula on the final level of aggregation due to the restrictions on . For that reason we compare simply the parameters ^(12), ^(13) and ^(23). This is due to the fact that for the most Archimedean copulae, the larger the parameters the stronger is the dependency (the larger is the parameter the larger is Kendalls  correlation coefficient). Let the strongest dependence be in the first pair ^1 d=ef ^(12) = max{^(12), ^(13), ^(23)}, then I1 = {1, 2} and we introduce the pseudovariable Z1 d=ef C1(I1; ^1) = C1(u1, u2; ^(12)). On the next and final step for this example we join together u3 and Z1. The theoretical validation is also reported by Proposition 1 of Okhrin, Okhrin, and Schmid (2011b) stating that HAC can be uniquely recovered from the marginal distribution functions and all bivariate copula functions.
In practice, the marginal distributions Fj, j = 1, . . . , d, are either parametrically or nonparametrically estimated in advance, whereby Fj(·) is an estimator of the marginal cdf Fj. Accordingly, the marginal densities f^j(·), j = 1, . . . , d, are estimated by an appropriate kernel density estimator. If we estimate the margins parametrically then Fj(·) = Fj(·, ^j), where j denotes the vector of parameters of the j-th margin.
The estimation of the copula parameters on each step of the iteration can be sketched as

Ostap Okhrin, Alexander Ristig

follows: at the first stage, we estimate the parameter of the copula at the first hierarchical level assuming that the marginal distributions are known. At further stages the next level copula parameter is estimated assuming that the margins as well as the copula parameters at lower levels are known. Let X = {xij} be the respective sample, for i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , d, and  = (1, . . . , d-1) be the parameters of the copula starting with the lowest up to the highest level. The multi-stage ML estimator  solves the system

where sj is referred to the two (pseudo)-variables considered at the j-th estimation stage. Note, a d-dimensional density f can be split in the copula density c and the product of the marginal densities. Chen and Fan (2006) and Okhrin et al. (2011a) provide asymptotic behaviour of the estimates. As long as the structure is determined through grouping binary structures, it seems to be appropriate to estimate Kendall's  at each step of the iteration and exploit the bivariate relationship between Archimedean copulae and Kendall's  (·), implied through Proposition 1.1 of Genest and Rivest (1993), see table 2. On the other hand, the asymptotic theory for Kendall's  is usually restricted to the two-dimensional case and cannot be carried over to a higher-dimensional framework as necessary for the considered purpose. Moreover, the copula parameters j,j = 1, . . . , d - 1, estimated with Kendall's  cannot be guaranteed to be increasing from the lowest to the highest hierarchical level and therefore, the estimated copula can fail to be a properly defined cdf. In the ML setup, this problem is tackled by shortening the feasible parameter space.

3. Applications of HAC
Core of the HAC package is the function estimate.copula estimating the parameters and determining the structure for given data. Let us consider a dataset from Yahoo! Finance consisting of the log-returns of four oil corporations: Chevron Corporation (CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (FP), covering n = 283 observations from 20110202 to 20120319. Time dependencies are removed by usual ARMA-GARCH models, whose standardized residuals are employed as sample in the subsequent analysis.

The returned object result is of class hac, whose properties are explored below.

The multi-step estimation procedure is illustrated in table 3 for the four-dimensional example

from above. At the lowest hierarchical level, the parameter of all bivariate copulae are esti-

mated. The couple (XCVX, XXOM) produces the strongest dependency, hence the best fit. Then,

is

XCVX are substituted by this pseudo variable in the dataset. At the next nesting level the

parameters of all bivariate subsets are estimated and the variables XFP and XRDSA exhibit the

best fit. Finally, the realizations of the remaining random variables Z(CVX.XOM) and Z(FP.RDSA) are

grouped at the highest level of the hierarchy, where Z(FP.RDSA) is defined analogously to Z .(CVX.XOM)

In general, estimate.copula includes the following arguments:

> names(formals(estimate.copula))

[1] "X"

"type"

[6] "agg.method" "margins"

[11] "..."

"method" "hac" "theta.eps" "na.rm"

"epsilon" "max.min"

The whole procedure is divided in three (optional) computational blocks. First, the margins are specified. Secondly, the copula parameter, , is estimated through the multi-stage procedure as explained above and finally the HAC is checked for aggregation possibilities. The margins of the (n×d) data matrix, X, are assumed to follow the standard Uniform distribution by default, i.e., margins = NULL, but the function permits non-uniformly distributed data as input, if the argument margins is specified. The marginal distributions can be determined non-parametrically, margins = "edf", or in a parametric way, e.g., margins = "norm". Following the latter approach, the log-likelihood of the marginal Distributions is optimized with respect to the first (and second) parameter(s) of the density dxxx. Basing on these estimates, the values of the univariate margins are computed. If the argument is defined as scalar,

Ostap Okhrin, Alexander Ristig

7

all margins are computed according to this specification. Otherwise, different margins can be defined, e.g., margins = c("norm", "t", "edf") for a three-dimensional sample. Except the Uniform distribution, all continuous Distributions of the stats package are available: "beta", "cauchy", "chisq", "exp", "f", "gamma", "lnorm", "norm", "t" and "weibull". The values of non-parametrically estimated distributions are computed accordingly to

n
F (x) = (n + 1)-1 I (Xi  x) .
i=1

(4)

Inappropriate usage of this argument might lead to misspecified margins, e.g., margins = "exp" although the sample contains negative values. Even though the margins might be assumed to follow parametric distributions if margins != NULL, no joint loglikelihood is maximized, but the margins are estimated in advance. As the asymptotic theory works well for parametric and nonparametric estimation of margins, for the univariate analysis we refer to other built-in packages. In practice, the column names of X should be specified, as the default names X1, X2, ... are given otherwise.
A further optional argument of estimate.copula determines the estimation method. We present three procedures: based on quasi ML, on Kendall's TAU and full ML FML respectively. Generally, the implemented HAC types are not able to describe negative dependence, for which reason any identified negative dependence is set to the predefined minimal correlation theta.eps equal to 0.001 by default, if method = TAU. If a simple Archimedean copula is fitted to the data, the routines of the copula package are imported, see Yan (2007); Kojadinovic and Yan (2010). The supplementary function theta2tau computes Kendall's rank correlation coefficient basing on the value(s) of the dependency parameter(s), whereas tau2theta corresponds to the inverse function, see table 2.
At the final computational step of the procedure the binary HAC is checked for aggregation possibilities, if epsilon > 0. Then, the new dependency parameter is computed according to the specification agg.method, i.e., the "min", "max" or "mean" of the original parameters. To emphasize this point, recall the four-dimensional binary HAC

C(u1, . . . , u4; (((12)3)4), ) = 3 -31  C{u1, . . . , u3; ((12)3), (1, 2) } + -31(u4) ,
from section 2. If we assume additionally 1  2, such that 1 - 2 < , the copula C can be approximated by

C(u1, . . . , u4; ((123)4), ) = 3 -31  C{u1, . . . , u3; (123), } + -31(u4) ,
where  = (1 + 2)/2. This is referred to as the associativity property of Archimedean copulae, see Theorem 4.1.5 of Nelsen (2006). If the variables of two nodes are aggregated, the new copula is checked for aggregation possibilities as well. Beside the threshold approach, the realized estimates ^1 and ^2 can obviously be used to test H0 : 1 - 2 = 0, since the asymptotic distribution is known. On the other hand, this approach is extremely computationally expensive. The estimation results for the non-aggregated and the aggregated cases are presented in the following:

3.1. The hac object
hac objects can be constructed by the general function hac, with the same name as the object it creates, and its simplified version hac.full for building fully nested HAC. For instance, consider the construction of a four-dimensional fully nested HAC with Gumbel generator, i.e.,
> G.cop = hac.full(type = HAC_GUMBEL, + y = c("X4", "X3", "X2", "X1"), + theta = c(1.1, 1.8, 2.5)) > G.cop
Class: hac Generator: Gumbel (((X1.X2)_{2.5}.X3)_{1.8}.X4)_{1.1}
where y denotes the vector of variables of class character and theta denotes the vector of dependency parameters. The parameters should be ascending ordered, so that the first parameter, 1.1, is referred to the initial node of the HAC and the last parameter, 2.5, corresponds to the first hierarchical level with variables "X1" and "X2". Guarantee that the vector y contains one element more than the vector theta. The returned output of hac objects is structured by three lines: (i) the object's Class, (ii) the Generator function and (iii) the HAC structure s. The structure can also be produced

Ostap Okhrin, Alexander Ristig

by the supplementary function tree2str. Variables, grouped at the same node are separated by a dot "." and the dependency parameters are printed within the curly parentheses. Partially nested Archimedean copulae are constructed by hac with the main argument tree. For a better understanding let us first consider a four-dimensional simple Archimedean copula with dependency parameter  = 2:
> hac(tree = list("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", 2))
Class: hac Generator: Gumbel (X1.X2.X3.X4)_{2}
Obviously, the copula tree is constructed by a list consisting of four character objects, i.e., "X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", and a number, which denotes the dependency parameter of the Archimedean copula. According to the theoretical construction of HAC in section 2, we can induce structure by substituting margins through a subcopula. The four variables "X1", "X2", "X3", "X4" can for example be structured by
> hac(tree = list(list("X1", "X2", 2.5), "X3", "X4", 1.5))
Class: hac Generator: Gumbel ((X1.X2)_{2.5}.X3.X4)_{1.5}
where the nested component, list("X1", "X2", 2.5), is referred to the subcopula of the lower hierarchical level. Note, that the nested component is of the same general form list(..., numeric(1)) as the simple Archimedean copula, where numeric(1) denotes the dependency parameter and "..." refers to arbitrary variables and subcopulae, which may contain subcopulae as well, like presented in the following
> HAC = hac(tree = list(list("Y1", list("Z3", "Z4", 3), "Y2", 2.5), + list("Z1", "Z2", 2), list("X1", "X2", 2.4), + "X3", "X4", 1.5)) > HAC
Class: hac Generator: Gumbel ((Y1.(Z3.Z4)_{3}.Y2)_{2.5}.(Z1.Z2)_{2}.(X1.X2)_{2.4}.X3.X4)_{1.5}
We cannot avoid the notation becoming more cumbersome for higher dimension, but the principle stays the same for arbitrary dimensions, i.e., variables are substituted by lists of the general form list(..., numeric(1)). The function hac provides a further argument for specifying the type of the HAC.
3.2. Graphics
As the string representation of the structure becomes more unclear as dimension increases, the package allows to produce graphics of hac objects by the standard generic plot function. Figure 3 illustrates for example the dependence structure of the lastly defined object HAC.

> plot(HAC, cex = 0.8, circles = 0.35)

The explanatory power of these plots can be enhanced by several of the usual plot parameters, e.g.,

> names(formals(plot.hac))

[1] "x" [7] "fg" [13] "theta"

"xlim" "bg" "h"

"ylim" "col.t" "l"

"xlab" "lwd" "circles"

"ylab" "index" "digits"

"col" "numbering" "..."

where the optional, boolean argument theta determines, whether the dependency parameter of the copula  or Kendall's  is printed, whereby Kendall's  cannot be easily interpreted in the usual way for more than two dimensions. If index = TRUE, strings illustrating the subcopulae of the nodes, are used as subsrcipts of the dependency parameters. If additionally numbering = TRUE, the parameters are numbered, such that the subscripts correspond to the estimation stages, if the non-aggregated output of estimate.copula is plotted. The radius of the circles, the width l and the height h of the rectangles and the specific colors of the lines and the text can be adjusted. Further arguments "..." can for example be used to modify the font size cex or to include a subtitle sub.

3.3. Random sampling
To be in line with other R-packages providing tools for different univariate and multivariate distributions we provide: (i) dHAC for computing the values of the copula density, (ii) pHAC for the cumulative distribution function and (iii) rAC and rHAC for simulations. rAC is based on the algorithm of Marshall and Olkin (1988) for sampling from simple Archimedean copulae and rHAC simulates from arbitrary HAC as suggested in Hofert and Ma¨chler (2011), who summarize the procedure for the former nacopula package as follows:

The function requires only two arguments: (i) the sample size n and (ii) an object of the class hac specifying the characteristics of the underlying HAC, e.g.,
> sim.data = rHAC(500, G.cop) > pairs(sim.data, pch = 20)
In particular the contributions of McNeil (2008), Hofert (2008) and Hofert (2011) provide the theoretical foundations to sample computationally efficient random vectors from HACs. Since the functions of the HAC package are not directly compatible with R-objects for nested Archimedean copula of the copula package and vice versa, we implemented algorithm 1 to avoid transformations of elaborate structures from one object to another. The algorithm exploits the recursively determined structure of HACs and samples from the major random components F0 and F01, which are presented in table 3, where S denotes the stable distribution with S1 parametrization,  denotes the Gamma distribution and S refers to the exponentially titled stable distribution. Consider Nolan (1997); Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994) for the first, Ahrens and Dieter (1974, 1982) for the second and Hofert (2011); Hofert and Ma¨chler (2011) for the third as a reference.
3.4. The cdf and density
The arguments for pHAC are a hac object and a sample X, whose column names should be identical to the variables' names of the hac object, e.g.,
> probs = pHAC(X = sim.data, hac = G.cop)
As the copula density is defined as d-th derivative of the copula C with respect to the arguments uj, j = 1, . . . , d, c.f. Savu and Trede (2010), the explicit form of the density varies with the structure of the underlying HAC. Hence, including the explicit form of all possible

d-dimensional copula densities is absolutely unrealistic in practice. Our function dHAC derives an analytical expression of the density for a given hac object, which can be instantaneously evaluated, if eval = TRUE. The analytical expression of the density is found by subsequently using the D function to differentiate the algebraic form of the copula "symbolically" with respect to the variables of the inserted hac object. Although the derivation and evaluation of the density is either computationally or numerically demanding, dHAC provides a flexible way to work with the HAC densities in practice, because they have not to be derived manually or numerically. Since the densities of the two-dimensional Archimedean copulae are frequently called during the multi-stage estimation procedure, their closed form expressions are given explicitly.
3.5. Empirical copula
As long as our package does not cover goodness-of-fit tests, which are difficult to implement in general and involve intensive computational techniques via bootstrapping, see Genest, R´emillard, and Beaudoin (2009), it might be difficult to justify the choice of a parametric assumption. However, the values of probs can be compared to the values the corresponding empirical copula, i.e.,

nd

C (u1, . . . , ud) = n-1

I Fj (Xij)  uj ,

i=1 j=1

where Fj denotes the estimated marginal distribution function of variable Xj. Figure 5 suggests a proper fit of the empirical copula computed by

> probs.emp = emp.copula.self(sim.data, proc = "M")

There are two functions, which can be used for computing the empirical copula:

> emp.copula(u, x, proc = "M", sort = "none", margins = NULL, + na.rm = FALSE, ...) > emp.copula.self(x, proc = "M", sort = "none", margins = NULL, + na.rm = FALSE, ...)

The difference in the arguments of these functions is, that emp.copula requires a matrix u, at which the function is evaluated. In contrast, emp.copula.self evaluates the sample x itself. The argument proc enables the user to choose between two computational methods. We recommend to use the default method, proc = "M", which is based on matrix manipulations, because its computational time is just a small fraction of the taken time of method "A", see figure 6. However, method "M" is sensitive with respect to the size of the working memory and therefore inapplicable for very large datasets. Figure 6 illustrates rapidly increasing computational times of the matrix based method for more than 5000 observations until the method collapses. In contrast, the runtimes of the alternative method proc = "A" are more robust against increasing the sample size. An other option to deal with large datasets is specifying the matrix u manually in order to reduce the number of vectors to evaluate.

4. Simulation study

To ensure the accuracy of the proposed methods, we generate random data from six copula models of different dimension Cij = C (·; si, i)j, for i = 1, 2, 3 and j = C, G, and show, that the parameter estimates almost coincide with the theoretical models. Here, j denotes the copula family (Clayton or Gumbel) and the structures are given by s1 = ((12)3), s2 = ((((12)3)4)5) and s3 = ((12)(34)5). The values of i are presented in the respective tables 4, 5 and chosen, such that the similar strength of dependence is produced by the Clayton and Gumbel based models.
The summary statistics of tables 4 and 5 rely on n = 1000 estimates, whereby only estimates with the same structure are to be compared. For this reason the procedure was m times replicated till n = 1000 estimates were available. As estimate.copula approximates the true structure, we set epsilon = 0.15 for C3, which is not based on a binary structure. The simulated samples for the copula estimation consist of 500 observations for the threedimensional case and 1000 for the five-dimensional cases. Tables 4 and 5 indicate, that the estimation procedure works properly for the suggested models, as the estimates are on average consistent with the true parameters. Nevertheless, a few points remain to mention: (i) the statistic s¯ denotes the percentage of correctly classified structures, i.e., s¯ = n/m, taking the permutation symmetry of the variables at the same node into consideration. The procedure detects the true structure as long as it is binary and the parameters exhibit the imposed distance. (ii) The estimates at lower hierarchical levels show a higher volatility than the estimates close to the initial node and the estimates for the Clayton models are more volatile than the estimates of the Gumbel based HACs. (iii) All estimated models indicate more imprecise estimates for higher nesting levels implying the high number of trials m to yield n = 1000 usable sample realizations of  for computing the summary statistics in the case of model C3, see table 5, which contains the frequencies for adopted misspecified structures and the averaged full ML estimates as well.
To shed some light on this issue, let us recover the estimation procedure step by step. After estimating 12 and 34 at the first and second interation step respectively, the realizations of the variables

Z12 d=ef ^12 Z34 d=ef ^34

-^112 {F1 (X1)} + -^112 {F2 (X2)} -^314 {F3 (X3)} + -^314 {F4 (X4)}

are computed. At the next step, the pseudo variables are grouped and the corresponding
parameter is apparently overestimated. If additionally the parameter at the fourth estimation stage is underestimated, like the parameter of the initial node for the C2C model, the variables of the first and second node of the binary structure cannot be aggregated, i.e., ^((12)(34)) - ^(((12)(34))5) < 0.15. Hence, the procedure leads to the binary approximation s = (((12)(34))5) for 62.71% of the Gumbel and 93.95% of the Clayton based HACs respec-
tively. The distributions based on this binary structure are however very good approximations
of the true distributions and provide more flexibility. The gains from the full ML approach
regarding the precision are only observable at the root node of the copula. However, this
minor improvement is costly since the results are based on a preestimated structure. Note,
any Warning messages related to the full ML estimation stating that NaNs were produced are reasoned by the numerically challenging evaluation of the density as mentioned above.

Irrespective of this inaccuracy, the distributions of samples from the nacopula package can also be reconstructed by the HAC package with identical results.
5. Conclusion
The package HAC focuses on the computationally efficient estimation of hierarchical Archimedean copula, which is based on grouping binary structures within a recursive multistage ML procedure. Its theoretical and practical advantages are (i) the avoiding of the demanding asymptotic theory, which arises due to one-step ML estimation and (ii) the consecutive optimization of the two-dimensional log-likelihood instead of the singular optimization of the d-dimensional one. Since HACs permit to model high-dimensional random variables, the package allows to plot the related hac objects. According to the usual naming of distributions in R, we provide dHAC, pHAC and rHAC to compute the values of density- and distribution functions or to sample from arbitrary HACs. The constructed framework can be easily extended to generator families for which the required nesting condition is fulfilled, e.g., Frank and Joe. Finally, the accuracy of the methods is shown in a small simulation study.
